Introduction

NSECT flight has garnered a lot of attention from both the engineering and biology communities in the recent 
decades, often driven by an interest in bioinspired or bio-mimicked design of small unmanned aerial vehicles, 
called Micro-air vehicles (MAVs). MAVs are classified as miniature aerial vehicles with wingspans less than 15cm1. 
Given their small size compared to conventional drones, MAVs have even more potential to revolutionize our 
sensing and information gathering capabilities in areas such as environmental monitoring and homeland security1. 
There are two key challenges in MAV development that need to be addressed: i) their power efficiency and ii) 
stability in an unsteady flight environment2. State-of-the-art MAVs, e.g. the Nano Hummingbird3, DelFly4, or 
Harvard’s robotic fly5 have limited onboard power sources due to their small sizes. Even larger commercially 
available drones can only fly 10 to 25 minutes on the onboard battery. Moreover, the flight environment is often 
unsteady with wind gusts of magnitudes that are the same as their operating speeds. 
Biological flyers showcase desirable flight characteristics and performance in rapid maneuvers1 that can guide 
the design of MAVs. These flapping flyers utilize wing kinematics, deformable wing shapes, and large scale vortical 
structures to enhance lift and thrust6. For decades, the aerodynamics of insect flight remained inexplicable. A well-
known example is the myth that bumblebees cannot fly according to the classical, aerodynamics theories7. Since 
then, many findings on unsteady lift enhancing mechanisms, such as the clap and fling8, dynamic stall via leading-
edge vortices9, wake-capture10,11, and rotational forces due to combined translation and rotation10,12, have enhanced 
our understanding of how insects stay aloft6. These unsteady physical processes are particularly important for small 
flyers, such as insects, which operate at low Reynolds number of around O(102) to O(103). In low Reynolds number 
regimes, both viscous, inertial, and unsteady effects are important. Furthermore, the aerodynamic efficiency is 
reduced significantly for stationary non-flapping flight at lower Reynolds numbers, compared to that of passenger 
airplanes6,13. 

Butterflies are also known to use clap and peel, a variant of clap and fling, wake-capture, leading-edge vortex, 
and rotational mechanisms14. However, compared to the wealth of research on the aerodynamics of biological flyers 

, bees16,17

such as flies10,15 , dragonflies18–22, as well as birds and bats6, the flight of butterflies remains inadequately 
understood due to their many unique characteristics. They are extremely evasive with agile maneuvers23–26 and large 
body undulations with closely coupled wing-body interaction25,27. Biologists have conjectured that butterflies 
became evasive to escape from predators, such as birds28–30. Among these flapping flyers, the Monarch butterfly, 
Danaus plexippus, stands out with the longest migration distance among insects -up to 4,000 km over the course of 

2

three months31–33. They fly from eastern North America to central Mexico during the fall34,35. Glider pilots have 
spotted migrating Monarch butterflies at an altitude of 1,250 m36. At these high altitudes, the Monarch can take 
advantage of favorable weather and wind patterns in the boundary layer of the earth31,37,38, presumably to conserve 

39,40

energy . They use magnetic and sun compasses for navigation to Mexico41. Their long migration suggests that 
they are extremely efficient flyers. Moreover, they flap, glide29, and perform agile maneuvers while climbing up and 
down with ease23. 

However, even though the morphological characteristics of the Monarch butterflies are well studied42,43, the 
structural and aerodynamic mechanisms behind their intriguing maneuverability has not been elucidated. Also, 
butterfly wing area is relatively large with fore and hindwings that flap in sync44, unlike dragonflies with relatively 
long wings often flapping out of sync20,21. Furthermore, there are limited experimental results that characterize the 
aerodynamics of their large flexible wings with complex vein structures45–47. 

Many insect motion measurements consider tethered flight18 or hovering flight8,18,42. However, measurements of 
tethered insects may not represent the actual motion in free flight48. The main difficulty faced in recording kinematic 
data of a forward flying insect is that it must fly through a relatively small volume that is in full view of the cameras. 
Many studies have used wind tunnels26,42,48 or 2D image processing45. 3D photogrammetric methods27,49–52 were also 
used that capture the three-dimensional wing shape deformation of dragonfly wings53, however these measurements 
are still limited to a relatively small capture volume. 

In our earlier work, we used twenty two high speed motion tracking cameras in a capture volume of 5.7 m×9.1 
m×3.0 m to measure and report the flapping wing angle and body trajectory of freely flying Monarch butterflies54. In 
this capture volume butterflies can fly unobstructed for a large sequence of flaps without requiring any extra 
equipment to entice flight. The number of high resolution cameras and the post processing software provide a 
unique opportunity to continuously record flights and accurately process entire flights in minutes so that a vast 
amount of data can be collected and compared to previous experiments. We showed that the wing beat frequency 
was similar to the undulating motion of the body, suggesting that the flapping wing aerodynamics and flight 
dynamics are closely coupled to each other. Moreover, the butterfly wings significantly deform during flight. An 
accurate measurement of both wing kinematics and the body motion is crucial to understand the dynamic flight 
stability and control of a flapping insect55.

For insects, with a notable exception of butterflies, the instantaneous information from flapping may not be as 
critical for simple flight dynamics models because flapping time is much faster than that of the entire flyer6,56. 
However, Lin et al.27 showed that moment of inertia of the body plays a significant role in maneuverability of the 
painted lady butterflies, implying that a time-averaged analysis may not be ideal in the analysis of butterfly flight. 
Moreover, the orientation and the shape of the butterfly body continuously change during flight57. Sunada et al.58 
showed that the moment generated by the body rotation caused the stroke plane orientation to change during flight, 
affecting the aerodynamics of the flapping wings. More recently, Fei and Yang59 carried out computational 
simulations of free flying butterflies by prescribing body angles and suggested that the butterfly adjusts its body 
orientation to minimize the drag force. However, their body angle was prescribed and the effects of the abdominal 
motion were left for future exploration. 

The relative motion of the abdomen with respect to the thorax within a flapping cycle as shown in Figure 1 
introduces additional complexity in analyzing the coupled wing-body motion. Monarch butterfly, as captured by our 
high speed camera system, continuously vary their relative angle between the thorax and abdomen, its thorax 
orientation with respect to the horizontal, and wing shape and orientation during a flight in a closely coupled 
manner. However, simultaneous quantification of the position and orientation of these different body parts and 
wings have not been reported before. Moreover, the aerodynamic and flight dynamic influence of a continuously 
rotating and deforming body on the butterfly flight and its coupled interaction with the flapping motion of the wings 
is not fully reported and understood. 

The objective of this paper is three-fold. Firstly, we resolve the overall body orientation into two main segments: 
the thorax and abdomen. In our previous study54, we reported the undulating motion of the body by tracking one 
marker placed on the thorax. In the current study, we provide a more detailed representation of the body by 
recording the thorax and the abdomen orientations separately. Secondly, we determine the instantaneous lift 
coefficient during climbing flight by considering a force balance. Thirdly, the state of the body during free flight is 
considered as a six degree-of-freedom representation including the three Euler angles. The flapping motion of the 
forewing is also represented as a six degree of freedom (DOF) system. We also report on the orientation of the 
stroke plane, consistent with the definition by Ellington60. We consider a single representative flight and quantify the 
body orientation and the wing angles during two flapping cycles. We collected 19 test flights using the above 
framework and a statistically relevant analysis will be reported in the future. 

The organization of the paper is as follows. First, we provide a detailed description of the experimental 
methodology in Section II. This is followed by the discussion of results from a single flight test with a focus on body 
and wing kinematics in Section III. Finally, we analyze and discuss the 6-DOF representation of the body and wing 
as well as the force balance on the resulting trajectory of a freely flying Monarch. 

II.􀀁 Methodology 

A.􀀁VICON Motion Capture System 

The experiments are conducted in the Autonomous Tracking and Optical Measurements (ATOM) laboratory at 
the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). The ATOM lab is a motion capture facility which uses 33 VICON 
T40s cameras, Mx Giganet connectivity node, and Nexus61 software, designed to track reflective markers in three-
dimensional space. Maximum capture volume dimensions are 17.2 m × 9.1 m × 3.0 m. In our previous work54, 
twenty two cameras were placed inside a smaller capture volume of 5.7 m × 9.1 m × 3.0 m to increase the number of 
cameras in the capture volume. The relatively large size of the capture volume with respect to the size of a butterfly 
enables data capture with unrestricted free flight trajectories. 

The VICON T40s cameras record at 515 fps at a full resolution of 4 megapixels. They are equipped with a near 
infrared (NIR) strobe, and visible light filters to allow for operation under a variety of lighting conditions. The 
cameras track reflective markers specifically designed for motion capture systems and efficiently reflect the NIR 
light. Each camera contains an onboard processor which locates all markers recorded in a frame, calculates a circle 
fit and determines the centroid of the circle. The location of the centroid and radius are the only data that are sent to 
the Mx Giganet during a motion capture test. The Mx Giganet calculates the three-dimensional position of all 
markers seen by two or more cameras simultaneously and sends it to the VICON workstation and into Nexus. 
Depending upon the user's requirements, the data can be transmitted to the monitor for real time monitoring, or 
recorded for post processing. The output environment is the virtual work space, which provides a three-dimensional 
representation of the location of all cameras and position of the markers detected.

The motion capture system requires regular calibration, which is done before data is collected in the form of a 
dynamic calibration. Calibration requires the use of a T-shaped tool provided by VICON. The calibration tool has 
five markers with precise spacing, which are recognized by each camera. During calibration, the calibration tool is 
waved around the capture volume. As two or more cameras see all five markers on the tool simultaneously, the 
Giganet compares the images from the cameras to the known dimensions of the wand. The position of each camera 
can then be calculated from this information. This process happens over one thousand times during a single 
calibration. The system can then record data using the same calibration until vibrations in the walls or slippage in the 
cameras causes a loss in resolution of the data. It was found that a calibration at the beginning of each day of testing 
was sufficient to retain uniform resolution.

The motion capture system detects the three-dimensional position of reflective markers. We tested various 
markers sizes and shapes in our previous study54. A reflective rectangular tape of 3 mm size was chosen for its 
significantly reduced mass. This choice was critical to reduce the changes in flight behavior that could be caused by 
the addition of mass to the butterfly. Although the 3 mm markers are lighter, they are not well suited for placement 
on the body. The width of the thorax is of the order of 5 mm and a single 3 mm marker covers more than half of the 
thorax width. Additionally, to isolate thorax and abdomen motion, more than one marker is needed on the body. To 
meet this requirement, we reduced the size of the marker further down to a circular shape with diameter of 1.8 mm. 
To track these smaller markers, the distance between the camera and the marker had to be reduced. The capture 
volume was shrunk to 1.2 m × 1.2 m × 1.5 m with 12 VICON cameras (Figure 2) without affecting the tracking 
quality. The markers were cut using a hole punch which enabled us to standardize the marker shape and mass. A 
Python script was generated to post-process the recorded data from the motion capture system. 

B. 
Monarch Butterflies and Testing Procedure 

Monarch butterfly body can be divided into head, thorax and the abdomen regions. Head is at the forefront of the 
body which houses a pair of eyes and antennae. Thorax is located behind the head and the fore and hindwings 
extend from the thorax. The third region of the body is called the abdomen, which is a flexible, segmented and 
slender region. A snapshot of the body orientation during flight is shown in Figure 3(a). The length of the head, 
thorax and abdomen are denoted by Lh, Lt and La respectively. The thorax of a Monarch butterfly is a relatively rigid 
structure when compared to the abdomen. The thorax and the abdomen sections normally are not aligned in a 
straight line (Figure 1). Instead, the abdomen is positioned around a hinge point with respect to the thorax and is free 
to move up and down or laterally. Morphological data for five butterfly specimens measured before the testing is 
given in Table 1. The wing mass when compared to the corresponding body mass measured for two specimens were 
around 20%.

The Monarch butterflies are shipped in individual boxes packed in a Styrofoam cooler with ice packs to ensure 
the butterflies were kept safe through the shipping process. Monarch butterflies use cool temperatures during 
overwintering to reduce usage of their lipid reserves62 which consequently reduces body activity and even impairs 
their ability to fly32. This state of reduced activity was used by the research team to more safely handle, measure and 
place markers on the specimens. During a week of testing, the first day consisted of removing each butterfly from 
the shipping container where they were kept chilled. The butterflies were kept cold as they were first weighed, 
markers were placed and were weighed again. The butterflies were then placed in terrariums under a directed 
incandescent lamp and allowed to rest overnight to attempt to reduce the potential effects of stress from handling 
and the addition of markers.

C.􀀁Marker configuration 

VICON motion capture system detects position of reflective markers. The sampling rate in this study was 200 
Hz, double the rate in our previous work54. Markers are placed at strategic locations on the body and the wings of 
butterfly as shown in Figure 4(a). Three circular markers with a diameter of 1.8 mm, denoted as T1, T2 and T3 are 

6 
American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics 


placed on the thorax. Markers T1 and T3 are carefully aligned with the longitudinal axis of the body with a separation 
distance lt=6.9 mm. A third marker T2 is placed at a small offset of 2.6 mm to the left of the longitudinal axis. The 
thorax orientation is denoted by the line segment joining the markers T1 and T3. Similarly, markers A1 and A2 are 
placed longitudinally on the lower end of the abdomen at a separation distance la=3.9 mm. The abdomen orientation 
is denoted by the line segment between A1 and A2. The orientation of the thorax and the abdomen with respect to the 
horizontal are denoted by the angles θ and χ respectively (Figure 3(b)). 

The wing markers are rectangular in shape with dimension of 2×3 mm. Markers RW1, RW2, RW3 are placed on 
the leading edge of the right forewing at 0.4R, 0.7R and 1.0R respectively, where R=48.94 mm is the half wing span 
measured from the wing root. A fourth marker, RW4, is placed on the trailing edge of the right forewing at 0.7R. The 
vector between RW2 and RW4 represents the chord of the right forewing at approximately 0.7R measured at 
c0.7R=18.9 mm. On the leading edge of the left forewing, three markers LW1, LW2, and LW3 are placed at 0.4R, 0.7R 
and 1.0R respectively. To prevent marker occlusion during the upstroke when the wings fold backwards, rectangular 
markers of 2×3 mm were placed on the underside of the wings at the same position as on the upper side of the wing.

The placement of reflective tape markers on the body and wings add to the total mass of the butterfly. Reduction 
in the marker size and mass was achieved by improved calibration techniques. The smallest markers used in the 
current study were circular markers with a diameter of 1.8 mm. The mass of each of these markers were measured to 
be 0.063% of the total mass of the butterfly. The rectangular, 2×3 mm marker, with a larger marker area, which were 
required to track the rapid motion of the wings, weighed around 0.3% of the butterfly mass. The individual 
contribution from each marker is summarized in Table 2. The total marker mass remains under 5% of the total 
butterfly mass. Eight rectangular markers on the right forewing combine to about 23% of the total wing mass. We 
will report on the effects of number of wing markers on the resulting butterfly flight more in detail in the future.

D.􀀁Coordinate Systems and Frames of Reference 

The VICON motion capture system records the three-dimensional coordinates of moving markers with respect to 
an inertial coordinate system (XIYIZI) (Figure 5), which is set during the calibration process. The origin of the inertial 
reference frame is set at one of the corners of the capture volume. The XI and YI axes form the horizontal plane and 
ZI axis points vertically upwards. At a given instant of time, position of a marker on the butterfly, say T3, in the 
inertial frame is identified by its position vector rT3,I. The inertial reference frame is rotated about the ZI axis to 
obtain a velocity vector aligned inertial frame (XVYVZV) such that the XV axis is aligned with the projection of the 
velocity vector, V, onto the horizontal plane. 

To describe the motion of the butterfly in a three-dimensional space, we define two additional reference frames: 
the body and wing reference frames. The body reference frame (xbybzb) is fixed on and moves with the body, is 
constructed with successive rotations along the three mutually perpendicular axes of the inertial frame. The origin of 
the body reference frame is located at the thorax of the butterfly at T3, which is close to the butterfly center of 
gravity. The xb axis is aligned along the longitudinal axis of the body, yb is directed to the left of the body 
perpendicular to the xb axis. The cross product of xb and yb axes gives the zb axis forming a right hand system. 

The right wing reference frame (xwywzw) is constructed with xw =RW4-RW2, yw pointing to the left, along the 
vector between RW3 and T3. Finally, zw is obtained by cross product of the xw and yw. The inertial, body and wing 
reference frames follow right hand convention. 

The motion and orientation of the butterfly body during flight in three-dimensional space is represented by a 6DOF 
system composed of the position in space and three angles. The three orientation angles are the Euler angles, 
which indicate the rotation of the body about coordinate axes of the inertial frame.

The thorax markers T1, T2 and T3 are assumed to represent a rigid body. To find the Euler angles of the thorax, it 
is necessary to find the rotation matrix RI→b about the origin that transforms the inertial frame of reference to the 
body frame of reference. The rotation matrix RI→b can be decomposed into a product of individual elementary 
rotation matrices around ZI, YI, XI axes as RI→b=RZ,I(ψ)RY,I(θ)RX,I(φ), where the rotation matrices are defined as

The rotation matrix RI→b is computed using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm. The SVD 
algorithm computes the optimal rotation in three-dimensional space that transforms one set of points to an another 
set by minimizing the root mean squared error. The position of thorax markers at a reference time t0 is taken as the 
baseline set of points. In order to determine RI→b at an arbitrary time t, we first find the centroid of the thorax 
markers T1, T2, and T3, rcentroid 
t as 

rcentroid 
t=(rT1+rT2+rT3)/3, (3) 

where the vector components are described in the inertia frame of reference. The translation vector between the 
current centroid, rcentroid 
t and the centroid in the reference configuration, rcentroid 
t0 is simply rtrans 
t = rcentroid 
t -rcentroid 
t0. 
In the second step, the optimal rotation matrix RI→b is computed that transforms the initial configuration to the final 
configuration after translating the current reference frame to the initial configuration such that both centroid 
collocate as shown in Figure 6. This process is repeated at each time instant with a new thorax orientation and a 
fixed reference orientation. As shown in Figure 6(a), the components of T3 marker in the inertial and body frame is 
related by 

rT3,b = RI→b(rT3,I -rtrans), (4) 

where the subscript t was omitted for simplicity. 

This procedure can be repeated to determine the body-to-wing rotation matrix Rb→w. A transformation from 
inertial reference frame to the wing reference frame is represented by the product of individual rotation matrices as 

RI→w = Rb→w RI→b (5)

The butterfly flight involves continuous translation and rotation of the body and wings. By quantifying the wing 
motion in the body frames of reference, we can eliminate the effects of the body motion on the wings. The flapping 
motion of the right forewing in the body frame can be expressed in terms of three Euler angles6: positional angle, ζ, 
feathering angle, α, and deviation angle, δ. As shown in Figure 7, clockwise rotation about the longitudinal axis of 
the body, xb, is defined as the positional angle ζ. The rotation about the yb axis is defined as the feathering angle α 
and rotation about zb axes is the deviation angle δ. The position of the wing tip at the beginning and end of the 
downstroke together with the wing root defines the stroke plane57. The positional angle at the beginning of the 
downstroke is denoted by ζmax and at the end of downstroke by ζmin. The stroke amplitude Ζ is defined as the total 
sweep angle between the beginning and end of downstroke as Ζ=ζmax -ζmin. An average positional angle is ζa=(ζmax 


ζmin)/2.

with respect to the horizontal plane. The stroke amplitude, Ζ, is defined as the total sweep angle between the 
beginning and end of downstroke. 

Similarly, a stroke plane is defined for wing upstroke by taking the position of the wing tip at the beginning and 
end of upstroke together with the wing root. The stroke plane orientation with respect to the horizontal is denoted by 
β. The stroke plane angle, β, not only changes during the up and downstroke, but during different stages of flight. 
The wing tip normally does not lie on the stroke plane except at the ends of strokes60. The deviation of the wing tip 
from the stroke plane is measured with the deviation angle δ. The feathering angle is also often described as the 
pitching angle of the wing6. It is not an angle of attack as the motion velocity vector of the butterfly also 
continuously changes its orientation.

Results and Discussion 

The methodology and tools developed in Section II are applied on a single butterfly flight to analyze the body 
and wing kinematics. The results presented here correspond to the Butterfly #1 in Table 1. Statistically significant 
data and analysis will be reported in the future. Section III.A introduces the trajectory of the climbing flight and the 
velocity component. This is followed by results from a force balance and lift coefficient in the vertical direction in 
Section III.B. Section III.C and Section III.D gives a detailed description of the wing and the body kinematics 
respectively. 

A.􀀁Trajectory of the Butterfly 

The trajectory of the butterfly is the path of the body during flight. Trajectory of the butterfly provides a means 
to classify a segment of flight into takeoff, climbing or level flight. In our earlier work54, we observed that the body 
of the butterfly shows an undulating motion with a significant vertical oscillation during flight. The body oscillation 
had the same frequency as the flapping motion but with a slight phase shift, suggesting that the body and wing 
motion are closely coupled. In this study, we provide a more comprehensive and detailed quantification of the body 
motion. The trajectory is defined with respect to the thorax of the butterfly. The three-dimensional trajectory of a 
free flying butterfly can be quite complex as illustrated in Figure 8. The butterfly is in a climbing trajectory in Figure

8, where the thorax is ascending at an average rate of 0.75 m/s during two flapping cycles as will be discussed in 
Section III.B. In addition to climbing, the butterfly can simultaneously vary the orientation of its thorax during flight 
as shown with a blue line in Figure 8. The projection of the trajectory and the thorax axis on the x-y and y-z planes 
show undulating trajectory and a continuously changing thorax orientation. 
Figure 8. (a) Three-dimensional trajectory of the butterfly in climbing flight. The T1 marker position is 
indicated by a red dot every 5 ms. The orientation of the thorax at each frame is shown by a red line. The 
two-dimensional projections on the coordinate planes are also indicated in blue. (b) The projection of the 
thorax T1-T3 and the local velocity vector on the horizontal plane. T1 marker is shown as a dot. (c) The yaw 
angle is defined as the difference of the thorax and the velocity vector projection on the horizontal. 
Figure 9(a) shows the position of the T1 marker during two flapping cycles in the inertial frame. The xcomponent 
of the T1 marker in Figure 9(a) shows minimal spatial variation with a change in position of about 0.03 
m in two flapping cycles. On the other hand, change in the y and the z position in the same duration is around 0.19 m 
and 0.13 m respectively. The undulating oscillations of the thorax is noticeable between up and downstroke motions. 
The velocity components of the T1 marker are shown in Figure 9(b). The velocity components of the T1 marker 
shows prominent oscillations when compared to the position. In fact, all three velocity components of the thorax 
show an increase during downstroke and a decrease during upstroke. The Vx and Vz components are positive whereas 
Vy is negative. The mean velocity magnitude is 1.28 m/s.

B. 
Force Balance and Lift Coefficient 

Figure 10 shows the trajectory, corresponding variation of the lift coefficient and vertical force during two 
flapping cycles in a climbing flight. Figure 10(a) clearly depicts two distinct climbing regime. The climb rates are 

1.07 m/s and 1.09 m/s in the faster climb regime from the middle of the downstroke to the middle of the upstroke. 
During the slower climb regime, the rates are 0.44 m/s and 0.52 m/s from the middle of the upstroke to the middle of 
the downstroke. 
The lift coefficient is determined from the force balance on the thorax marker T1,

(6) 

where m is the butterfly mass, az is the acceleration in vertical direction, L is the lift, and g is the gravitational 
constant. The acceleration az was calculated by numerically differentiating the z position of the T1 marker (Figure 10 
(a)) twice in time. Then the lift coefficient CL follows as

where 􀀁 is the air density, S is the wing area, and V is the speed of the thorax. Since the morphological (Table 1) and 
motion parameters are known, the instantaneous lift coefficient can be determined as shown in Figure 10(b). A low 
pass filter is used to remove high frequency oscillations that result from numerical differentiation in velocity and 
acceleration components. 

The ratio between the weight mg and the wing area S is also called the wing loading, an important parameter that 
characterizes the flight performance. The wing loading for this particular butterfly was 1.61 N/m2, which is much 
lower than birds, e.g. Albatross63: 140 N/m2, or man-made aircrafts, e.g. Boeing 74763: 7570 N/m2. Such a low wing 
loading in general implies a higher maneuverability, lower take-off and landing speeds and higher climb rate. The 
flight trajectory considered here is a climbing flight where the butterfly climbs 0.12 m in 0.16 s during two flapping 
cycles, i.e. a climb rate of 0.75 m/s. 

Positive lift is generated during the downstroke, whereas the lift is negative during the upstroke with a much 
lower magnitude as seen in Figure 10(b). The lift coefficient at the beginning of downstroke at t=0.054 s is positive 
with CL=3.8. A small drop in CL observed in the first quarter of the downstroke followed by an increase to a 
maximum of CL=10.8 at t=0.085 s. These lift coefficients are much greater than the conventional values on man-
made aircraft wings. During downstroke, the wing flaps downward producing positive lift propelling the butterfly 
upward and forward. As a result, the climb rate increases to 1.07 m/s and 1.09 m/s from the middle of the 
downstroke until the middle of the upstroke. The magnitude of the lift coefficient at the end of the downstroke at 

12 
American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics 


t=0.105 s is close to zero and turns negative during most of the upstroke with a minimum of CL=-2.5 near the middle 
of upstroke at t=0.125 s. The climb rate reduces accordingly to 0.44 m/s and 0.52 m/s for the two upstrokes shown 
in Figure 10(a). Average lift coefficient for two flapping cycles is found to be 1.93. 

The lift force in the vertical direction calculated with Eq. (6) is shown in Figure 10(c). The lift force shown in 
mN is similar to the CL curve. The only difference is that the velocity of the thorax, V, continuously varies in time in 
Eq. (7) as shown in Figure 9(b). The weight of the butterfly with mass m=0.481 g, with markers taken into account 
is indicated by a red horizontal line. The total weight of the butterfly is Wb=4.71 mN and the averaged vertical force 
is slightly higher at 5.3 mN when averaged over two motion cycles. The butterfly is able to climb with an average 
climb rate of 0.75 m/s. During downstroke, the butterfly generates force in the vertical direction and at midstroke, 
the force exceeds its weight roughly by a factor of six. The net force in the upstroke drops to negative. As a 
consequence, the climb rate reduces during the upstroke (Figure 10(a)). The climb rate is still positive due to the 
momentum from the previous downstroke. The climb rate was observed to be higher between the transition from 

of the flapping motion on an average was found to be around 151 deg.

C.􀀁Flapping Wing Kinematics 

Flapping angle, γ, is defined as the angle between the forewings as shown in Figure 11. It is measured by 
markers at the tip of the left and right forewings, rLW3 and rRW3, respectively in the body reference frame with origin 

at T3. In particular, the flapping angle, γ, was calculated as

Body angles are computed at each time instant. The Euler angles for two flapping cycles are shown in Figure 
12(b). The body pitch angle, θ, which is the angle between the thorax and the horizontal plane, varies between θ=7 
deg and θ=42 deg. The body pitch shows a periodic oscillation similar to the flapping angle, γ, but with a small 
phase lag. 

At the beginning of the upstroke at t=0.105 s, the flapping angle is at its highest with γ=317.7 deg. The pitch 
angle of the thorax is close to θ=29 deg at this time instant. The flapping angle decreases during the upstroke as the 
wings approach each other and the lift coefficient drops causing the butterfly to lose the climb rate. Moreover, the 
body as a whole is tilted backward, thus increasing the pitch angle. The pitch angle attains a value of around θ=33.3 
deg at the mid of upstroke at t=0.125 s. During the second half of the upstroke, the thorax tilts forward slightly 
causing the body pitch angle to drop. By the end of upstroke at t=0.145 s, the pitch angle has slightly decreased to 
θ=28.3 deg. The flapping angle at this point is at its lowest of with γ=23.4 deg. At the beginning of the downstroke, 
the body is continuing to tilt forward which decreases the pitch angle further and at the mid of downstroke at t=0.17 
s, the thorax attains its lowest pitch angle of θ=17 deg. The downward flapping of the wings and the pitch down 
motion of the thorax takes place simultaneously during the first half of the downstroke. Near the mid of second half 
of downstroke at t=0.175 s, the flapping angle is around γ=203 deg where the left and the right wings are spread out 
laterally and the lift generated is at its highest with CL=7.8 (Figure 10(b)). During the second half of the downstroke, 
the rate of climb increases and thorax simultaneously pitches up and attains θ=36.2 deg at the end of downstroke at 
t=0.19 s. 

The yaw angle in Figure 12(b) is defined as the rotation of the thorax about the ZV axis. The yaw angle varies 
between ψ=-8 deg to ψ=31 deg. In general, body orientation is closely related to the type of flight in consideration. 
Due to the close coupling that exists between body and wing motion, factors such as climb rate (e.g. take-off versus 
level flight), type of the maneuver (eg. straight versus turning) strongly influence the body orientation angles. 
Furthermore, to enable comparison between multiple flights while performing a statistical analysis, it is important to 
eliminate the dependence of body orientation angles on an arbitrarily-fixed inertial reference frame. A definition of 
angles based on local velocity vector enables a uniform comparison across several individual flights.

The wing Euler angles are calculated in the body frame of reference. Positional angle, ζ, has the largest stroke 
amplitude of Ζ=151 deg with an average of about ζa=76 deg in the two flapping cycles considered in Figure 12(c). 
The feathering angle, α, was mostly negative during upstroke with a maximum angle of α≈10 deg and a minimum 
angle of α≈-60 deg recorded during downstroke. In this climbing motion the orientation of the wing chord in the 
body frame of reference is tilted upwards as depicted in Figure 13. The deviation angle, δ, has a relatively lower 
magnitude of δ≈30 deg compared to the positional and feathering angles. The deviation angle, δ, exhibits dual peaks 

within a full flapping cycle.

corresponds to t=0.105 s and t=0.145 s in Figure 12(c). Leading edge, RW2, is shown as a dot. The feathering 
angle is negative in the clockwise rotation about the yb axis as seen here during upstroke. During downstroke, 
the counterclockwise rotation is smaller. 

Dominant frequencies of the body and wing angles in Figure 12 are determined with Fast Fourier Transform 
(FFT). Before performing the FFT, the mean of each time series is calculated and the original data is subtracted from 
the mean. Figure 14 shows the results from the FFT analysis of the flapping body and wing angles. The flapping 
angle calculated with left and the right fore wings show a frequency of f=9.52 Hz (Figure 12(a)). Similarly, among 
the body angles, the body pitch angle appears to have the same frequency as the flapping motion with the yaw and 
roll angles showing a peak at 4.76 Hz, which is half the frequency of the wings. Among the wing angles, the 
positional and the feathering angle have a fundamental frequency of 9.52 Hz whereas the deviation angle has a 
higher frequency of 23.8 Hz, which is 2.5 times greater than the fundamental frequency. The deviation angle, unlike 
the positional and the feathering angle has two peaks within a halfstroke as seen in Figure 12(c) consistent with the 
observation in Figure 14(c).

In our earlier study54, the flapping frequency of Monarch butterflies was observed to be fairly uniform between 9 
Hz and 11 Hz, which is close to the frequency found in this study: f=9.52 Hz. In the current study, data is recorded 
at 200 Hz instead of 100 Hz as in our previous work, improving the accuracy. On the other hand, in the current work 
we only considered a single flight, whereas in our previous work we reported a statistically significant value from 75 
flights. Statistically significant data and analysis of the butterfly flight with the current improved experimental setup 
will be reported in the future. Similar to our earlier finding that the frequency of the undulating motion of the body 
was the same as the flapping frequency, current observations indicate that the wing motion and body motion are 
closely coupled to each other. The body of the butterfly pulls up during the downstroke and undulates with a phase 
lag with respect to the wing motion as is clearly seen in Figure 1. Most flight dynamics models of flapping wing 
insects neglect the influence of wing mass and inertia on the body motion55,64 by assuming that the flapping 
frequency is much higher than that of body oscillation and that wing mass is much smaller than the body mass. 
However, for Monarch butterflies, the flapping and body frequencies are similar, and a simplified flight dynamics 
models cannot be used to analyze the dynamics and stability of butterflies. 

The trace of the RW3 marker in the body frame of reference during a full flapping cycle between t=0.105 s and 
t=0.19 s is shown in Figure 15. The upstroke position of RW3 is shown in red and the downstroke in blue. The 
stroke plane is identified as the plane formed by the T3 marker in green and the position of RW3 at the beginning of 
upstroke and end of upstroke. By definition, the wing tip lies on the stroke plane at the ends of the stroke. It is 
observed that during upstroke, the wing tip in body frame of reference does not cross the stroke plane and forms a 
U-shaped trajectory. However, during the downstroke, the wing tip crosses the stroke plane twice: once just after the 
beginning of the downstroke and once just before the end of the downstroke. The stroke plane makes a β=71.1 deg 
angle with the horizontal during this stroke. Wing tip markers in the stroke plane reference frame will be reported in 
the future.

D.􀀁Thorax and Abdomen Orientation 

The relative orientation of the abdomen with respect to the thorax continuously changes during flight as seen in 
Figure 1. Furthermore, the body orientation is closely coupled58 to the wing motion. In an earlier study54, we 
reported on the undulating trajectory of the thorax whose frequency closely matched that of the flapping motion with 
a slight phase lag. In the current study, we measure the individual orientation of the abdomen and the thorax motion 
by calculating their respective pitch angles with the horizontal. 

Figure 16(a) shows the evolution of the pitch angle of the thorax and the abdomen measured with the horizontal. 
The thorax pitch angle, θ, is calculated as the pitch angle of the longitudinal axis of the thorax represented by 
markers T1-T3. Abdomen pitch angle, χ, is calculated using A1-A2 markers as indicated in Figure 3(b). The 

16 
American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics 


difference between the two angles is also shown in Figure 16(a) where a difference angle close to zero indicates that 
the thorax and the abdomen are aligned. Abdomen, like thorax, shows an undulating motion with positive pitch 
angle which varies between χ=22 deg and χ=56 deg during two flapping cycles. At the beginning of the upstroke, 
the thorax and abdomen have nearly the same pitch angle of around θ=24 deg and χ=22 deg at t=0.105 s. During the 
second half of the upstroke, the abdomen angle begins to increase and continues to increase during the following 
downstroke reaching a peak at the middle of downstroke with χ=56 deg at t=0.165 s. During the same interval 
between t=0.145 s and t=0.165 s, the thorax shows an opposite trend with decreasing pitch angle with θ=16.6 deg at 
the middle of downstroke at t=0.165 s. The difference between the thorax-abdomen pitch angle is also the highest at 
the middle of the downstroke. At the middle of the downstroke, the instantaneous lift is also at maximum (Figure 
10(b)) and the butterfly has started to climb with the faster climb rate (Figure 10(a)). During the second half of the 
downstroke, the abdomen pitches down whereas the thorax pitches up and at the end of the downstroke at t=0.19 s, 
both the segments attain an aligned position with χ≈θ 
≈36.4 deg. When the thorax and abdomen are aligned, the 
butterfly is more or less in the faster climb rate regime (Figure 10(a)) with nearly zero or negative lift coefficient 
(Figure 10(b)). 

The markers T1-T3 and A1-A2 are shown in the YZ plane during the upstroke and downstroke in Figures 16(b) 
and (c) respectively. The thorax and abdomen are represented as a pair of red and black dashed lines at each frame 
with direction of climb indicated by an arrow. During upstroke, the relative orientation of the two segments remains 
nearly aligned as shown by their corresponding pitch angles. During downstroke, the pitch up of the thorax during 
the second half is noticeable and this corresponds to the climb rate of 1.09 m/s shown in Figure 10(a). 

The above observations correspond to a single climbing flight. A more comprehensive description of the body 
orientation and its possible relation to the climb rate will be reported in the future by considering a statistically 
significant number of flight segments.

Concluding Remarks 

Body motion and wing kinematics of a free flying Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexipus) in climbing trajectory 
was analyzed using 12 high-resolution motion-tracking cameras in a capture volume of 1.2 m × 1.2 m × 1.5 m. We 
developed the methodology and the tools needed to quantify the position and orientation of the thorax, abdomen, 
and wings as well as the instantaneous lift coefficient and climb rate, which can be applied to a large number of 
flights. 

Lift coefficient was calculated using a force balance on the body. Downstroke created a positive CL with a peak 
lift coefficient at the middle of downstroke of CL,max=10.8. Negative lift coefficient was observed during the 
upstroke with a smaller magnitude of CL,min=-2.5 at the mid of upstroke. As a result of the large lift peak during the 
downstroke and a relatively smaller minimum upstroke, the butterfly was able to climb with an average rate of 0.75 
m/s. Climb rate consistently was higher during the second half of the downstroke until the first half of the upstroke, 
when compared to climb rate during the other half. 

The body and wing orientation angles were calculated with a 6-DOF representation. The abdomen orientation 
with respect to the thorax changed during a flapping cycle with a pitched down abdomen observed during 
downstroke. Relative orientation of the abdomen follows an undulating trajectory with higher pitch angles near the 
first half of the downstroke. The thorax and the abdomen was aligned during the faster regime of the climb, whereas 
the relative angle between the thorax and the abdomen was at maximum near the middle of the downstroke, 
coinciding with the maximum CL and the end of the slower climb regime. 

The undulating body pitch angle was found to be closely related to the flapping motion. The positional and 
feather angles of the right forewing as well as the body pitch angle oscillated with a frequency of 9.52 Hz. The 
frequency of the wing deviation angle was 2.5 times the flapping frequency, whereas the frequency of the yaw angle 
of the body was half. The flapping angle of the fore wings was nearly sinusoidal with an amplitude of γ=151 deg. 
The stroke plane during a flapping cycle was calculated by tracing the wing tip marker of the right forewing at the 
ends of the stroke. The stroke plane orientation was found to be β=71.1 deg with the horizontal. 

Although the presented experimental capability and reported results provide a detailed quantification of the 
Monarch butterfly motion, we need to place the current results in the context that the current results are based on a 
single butterfly flight. Main goal of this paper is to present the experimental methodology. Statistically significant 
analysis of the additional flight tests will be reported in the future along with an analysis of the important physical 
mechanisms involved in the closely coupled wing-body interaction. For example, the wing motion will be 
considered in the stroke plane reference frame. 

The insights obtained from analysis presented here can be used to identify optimum flight parameters as well as 
provide an understanding of how butterflies use synchronized body-wing motion control their trajectory.
