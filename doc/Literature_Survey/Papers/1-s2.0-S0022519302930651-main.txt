We 
present 
a 
self-organizing 
model 
of 
group 
formation 
in 
three-dimensional 
space, 
and 
use 
it 
to 
investigate 
the 
spatial 
dynamics 
of 
animal 
groups 
such 
as 
fish 
schools 
and 
bird 
flocks. 
We 
reveal 
the 
existence 
of 
major 
group-level 
behavioural 
transitions 
related 
to 
minor 
changes 
in 
individual-level 
interactions. 
Further, 
we 
present 
the 
first 
evidence 
for 
collective 
memory 
in 
such 
animal 
groups 
(where 
the 
previous 
history 
of 
group 
structure 
influences 
the 
collective 
behaviour 
exhibited 
as 
individual 
interactions 
change) 
during 
the 
transition 
of 
a 
group 
from 
one 
type 
of 
collective 
behaviour 
to 
another. 
The 
model 
is 
then 
used 
to 
show 
how 
differences 
among 
individuals 
influence 
group 
structure, 
and 
how 
individuals 
employing 
simple, 
local 
rules 
of 
thumb, 
can 
accurately 
change 
their 
spatial 
position 
within 
a 
group 
(e.g. 
to 
move 
to 
the 
centre, 
the 
front, 
or 
the 
periphery) 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
information 
on 
their 
current 
position 
within 
the 
group 
as 
a 
whole. 
These 
results 
are 
considered 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
evolution 
and 
ecological 
importance 
of 
animal 
groups.

Introduction 


Many 
animal 
groups 
such 
as 
fish 
schools 
and 
bird 
flocks 
clearly 
display 
structural 
order, 
with 
the 
behaviour 
of 
the 
organisms 
so 
integrated 
that 
even 
though 
they 
may 
change 
shape 
and 
direction, 
they 
appear 
to 
move 
as 
a 
single 
coherent 
entity. 
Many 
of 
the 
collective 
behaviours 
exhibited 
by 
such 
groups 
can 
only 
be 
understood 
by 
considering 
the 
very 
large 
number 
of 
interactions 
among 
group 
members. 
Individual-
based 
computer 
simulations 
are 
a 
very 
useful 
analytical 
tool 
to 
study 
such 
groups, 
and

using 
this 
technique, 
it 
has 
been 
possible 
to 
demonstrate 
that 
group 
leadership, 
hierarchical 
control, 
and 
global 
information 
are 
not 
necessary 
for 
collective 
behaviour 
(Aoki, 
1982; 
Reynolds, 
1987; 
Huth 
& 
Wissel, 
1992; 
Gueron 
et al., 
1996; 
Czir!

ok 
et al., 
1997, 
1999; 
Warburton, 
1997; 
Helbing 
et al., 
2000). 
The 
simplest 
models 
of 
collective 
motion 
merely 
assume 
that 
individuals 
move 
at 
a 
constant 
speed 
and 
assume 
the 
average 
direction 
of 
motion 
(this 
direction 
being 
subject 
to 
error) 
of 
those 
within 
a 
local 
neighbourhood 
(Czir!

ok 
et al., 
1997, 
1999). 
Such 
models 
are 
useful 
since 
their 
minimalism 
allows 
them 
to 
be 
analysed 
using 
techniques 
developed 
for 
non-equilibrium 
physical 
systems

ok 
& 
Vicsek, 
2001). 
This 
comes 
at 
the 
cost 
of 
biological 
realism, 
however. 
For 
example, 
the 
particles 
neither 
avoid 
collisions 
nor 
exhibit 
attraction 
towards 
others. 
Consequently, 
they 
cannot 
form 
a 
self-bounded 
group 
when 
error 
is 
greater 
than 
zero, 
and 
thus 
these 
models 
cannot 
fully 
explain 
the 
clearly 
defined 
animal 
groups 
seen 
in 
many 
species. 


Here, 
we 
use 
a 
more 
biologically 
realistic 
(yet 
still 
simple) 
model 
of 
aggregation 
behaviour 
that 
is 
based 
upon 
an 
abstraction 
of 
aggregation 
tendencies 
evident 
in 
biological 
systems 
(Partridge 
& 
Pitcher, 
1980; 
Partridge, 
1982; 
Heppner, 
1997). 
Following 
the 
approach 
of 
Aoki 
(1982), 
Reynolds 
(1987) 
and 
Huth 
& 
Wissel 
(1992), 
we 
simulate 
the 
behaviour 
of 
individuals 
as 
resulting 
from 
local 
repulsion, 
alignment 
and 
attractive 
tendencies 
based 
upon 
the 
position 
and 
orientation 
of 
individuals 
relative 
to 
one 
another. 
In 
such 
models 
the 
individual 
behaviour 
results 
in 
group 
formation 
and 
cohesion, 
rather 
than 
fixing 
individual 
density 
within 
a 
periodic 
domain 
(as 
in 
the 
simplest 
models 
described 
above). 
Our 
simulation 
exhibits 
characteristic 
collective 
behaviours, 
similar 
to 
those 
of 
natural 
groups, 
when 
certain 
parameters 
are 
changed, 
and 
we 
discuss 
how 
these 
different 
types 
of 
collective 
behaviour 
are 
likely 
to 
influence 
the 
fitness 
of 
individuals 
within 
such 
groups. 
We 
also 
use 
the 
model 
to 
reveal 
for 
the 
first 
time 
a 
novel 
form 
of 
collective 
memory, 
where 
the 
previous 
history 
of 
the 
group 
structure 
influences 
collective 
behaviours 
as 
individual 
interactions 
change, 
even 
though 
the 
individuals 
have 
no 
knowledge 
of 
what 
that 
history 
is. 
We 
hypothesize 
that 
this 
hysteresis 
phenomenon 
may 
be 
an 
as 
yet 
unexplored 
property 
of 
real 
animal 
groups, 
and 
discuss 
the 
relevance 
of 
this 
finding 
to 
our 
understanding 
of 
the 
evolution 
of 
behaviour 
in 
grouping 
organisms. 


The 
spatial 
structuring 
within 
groups 
has 
important 
ecological 
and 
evolutionary 
consequences 
(Okubo, 
1980; 
Krause 
& 
Ruxton, 
2002). 
Despite 
this, 
the 
majority 
of 
previous 
studies 
have 
failed 
to 
consider 
that 
the 
costs 
and 
benefits 
of 
group 
living 
are 
dependent 
on 
the 
spatial 
positions 
individuals 
adopt 
(see, 
Krause, 
1994, 
for 
a 
review). 
Group 
members 
are 
not 
intrinsically 
identical 
(Pitcher 
et al., 
1985; 
Parrish, 
1989; 
DeBlois 
& 
Rose, 
1996; 
Krause 
et al., 
1996) 
and 


differences 
(e.g. 
behavioural 
state, 
age) 
are 
likely 
to 
influence 
the 
positions 
adopted 
by 
individuals 
within 
the 
group. 
In 
our 
model, 
we 
investigate 
how 
physical 
and/or 
motivational 
differences 
among 
individuals 
may 
influence 
the 
spatial 
positions 
of 
individuals 
within 
animal 
aggregations, 
and 
discuss 
how 
the 
results 
of 
the 
model 
may 
allow 
insight 
into 
the 
structuring 
seen 
within 
natural 
animal 
aggregates. 


The 
Model 


BEHAVIOURAL 
RULES: 
SUMMARY 


(1) 
Individuals 
attempt 
to 
maintain 
a 
minimum 
distance 
between 
themselves 
and 
others 
at 
all 
times. 
This 
rule 
has 
the 
highest 
priority 
and 
corresponds 
to 
a 
frequently 
observed 
behaviour 
of 
animals 
in 
nature 
(Krause 
& 
Ruxton, 
2002). 
(2) 
If 
individuals 
are 
not 
performing 
an 
avoidance 
manoeuvre 
(rule 
1) 
they 
tend 
to 
be 
attracted 
towards 
other 
individuals 
(to 
avoid 
being 
isolated) 
and 
to 
align 
themselves 
with 
neighbours 
(Partridge 
& 
Pitcher, 
1980; 
Partridge, 
1982). 
These 
behavioural 
tendencies 
are 
simulated 
using 
local 
perception 
and 
simple 
response 
behaviours. 
BEHAVIOURAL 
RULES: 
DESCRIPTION 


N individuals 
(i ¼ 
1, 
2,y, 
N) 
with 
position 
vectors 
ci, 
and 
unit 
direction 
vectors 
vi are 
simulated 
in 
continuous 
three-dimensional 
space. 
Time 
is 
partitioned 
into 
discrete 
time 
steps 
t with 
a 
regular 
spacing 
t: 
Here, 
t 
is 
set 
to 


0.1 
s, 
corresponding 
to 
the 
response 
latency 
of 
fish 
(Partridge 
& 
Pitcher, 
1980). 
In 
each 
time 
step, 
individuals 
assess 
the 
position 
and/or 
orientation 
of 
n neighbours 
within 
three 
non-
overlapping 
behavioural 
zones 
(described 
below; 
Fig. 
1). 
This 
information 
is 
used 
to 
determine 
a 
desired 
direction 
for 
each 
individual 
for 
the 
successive 
time 
step 
diðt þ 
tÞ 
using 
the 
following 
rules. 
Each 
individual 
attempts 
to 
maintain 
a 
minimum 
distance 
from 
others 
within 
a 
‘‘zone 
of 
repulsion’’ 
(zor), 
modelled 
as 
a 
sphere, 
centred 
on 
the 
individual, 
with 
radius 
rr.If 
nr neighbours 
are 
present 
in 
the 
zor at 
time 
t, 
individual 
i 
responds 
by 
moving 
away 
from 
neighbours

If

(nr ¼0), 
the

the

are 
spherical,

for

This

where

as

An

the

To

the

of

initially 
we 
assume 
that 
individuals 
move 
at 
a 
constant

(we 
investigate 
the

Following 
these 
rules 
individual 
trajectories 
can 
be 
integrated 
over 
time 
to 
explore 
how 
the 
behavioural 
responses 
influence 
collective 
behaviour.

(Table

Two

and 
the

Group 
polarization 
increases 
as 
the 
degree 
of 
alignment 
among 
individuals 
within 
the 
group 
increases, 
whereas 
the 
group 
angular

is 
the 
sum

of 
the 
group, 
cgroup [also 
known 
as 
the 
group

Angular 
momentum 
therefore 
measures 
the 
degree 
of 
rotation 
of 
the 
group 
about 
the 
group 
centre.

can

Group 
fragmentation 
is 
measured 
using 
an 
extension 
of 
the 
calculation 
of 
equivalence 
classes 
(Press 
et al., 
1992), 
where 
the 
criterion 
of 
interest 
is 
the 
presence 
of 
other 
individuals 
within 
the 
field 
of 
perception. 


The 
collective 
behaviour 
of 
the 
model 
is 
analysed 
after 
it 
reaches 
a 
dynamically 
stable 
state, 
where 
the 
values 
of 
the 
different 
system 
measures 
have 
stabilized 
(always 
within 
5000 
time 
steps, 
equivalent 
to 
8.3 
min 
of 
real 
time, 
for 
the 
range 
of 
parameters 
analysed 
here). 


To 
understand 
the 
influence 
of 
individual 
differences 
on 
spatial 
position 
within 
a 
group, 
we 
investigate 
the 
consequence 
of 
variation 
in 
speed 
s, 
turning 
rate 
y; 
error 
s; 
rr, 
ro and 
ra 
among 
individuals 
within 
a 
group. 
To 
simulate 
variation, 
the 
parameter 
under 
investigation 
is 
modified 
by 
a 
Gaussian 
distributed 
deviate 
independently 
drawn 
for 
each 
individual, 
and 
is 
then 
fixed 
at 
that 
value 
for 
the 
duration 
of 
the 
experiment. 
The 
standard 
deviation 
of 
this 
distribution 
determines 
the 
degree 
to 
which 
individuals 
differ 
with 
respect 
to 
that 
parameter 
within 
the 
group, 
and 
is 
investigated 
up 
to 
a 
cutoff 
point 
beyond 
which 
the 
group 
tends 
to 
fragment.

collective 
dynamical 
behaviours 
(Fig. 
3) 
which 
we 
have 
labelled 
as 
follows. 


Swarm: 
an 
aggregate 
with 
cohesion, 
but 
a 
low 
level 
of 
polarization 
(parallel 
alignment) 
among 
members 
(low 
pgroup) 
and 
low 
angular 
momentum 
(low 
mgroup). 
This 
occurs 
when 
individuals 
perform 
attraction 
and 
repulsion 
behaviours, 
but 
little 
or 
no 
parallel 
orientation 
(Fig. 
3(A); 
3(E) 
and 
(F), 
region 
a). 


Torus: 
individuals 
perpetually 
rotate 
around 
an 
empty 
core 
(milling). 
The 
direction 
of 
rotation 
is 
random. 
pgroup is 
low, 
but 
mgroup is 
high. 
This 
occurs 
when 
Dro is 
relatively 
small 
and 
Dra is 
relatively 
large 
(Fig. 
3(B); 
3(E) 
and 
(F), 
region 
b). 


Dynamic parallel group: 
the 
group 
exhibits 
high 
pgroup, 
but 
low 
mgroup. 
This 
type 
of 
group 
is 
much 
more 
mobile 
than 
the 
swarm 
or 
torus, 
and 
occurs 
at 
intermediate 
values 
of 
Dro with 
intermediate 
or 
high 
values 
of 
Dra (Fig. 
3(C); 


(E) 
and 
(F), 
region 
c). 
Highly parallel group:as 
Dro increases, 
the 
group 
self-organizes 
into 
a 
highly 
aligned 
arrangement 
(very 
high 
pgroup) 
with 
rectilinear 
movement 
(low 
mgroup) 
(Fig. 
3(D); 
(E) 
and 
(F), 
region 
d). 


Swarm 
behaviour 
is 
often 
seen 
in 
insects, 
such 
as 
mosquitoes 
and 
midges 
(Okubo 
& 
Chiang, 
1974; 
Ikawa 
& 
Okabe, 
1997), 
and 
can 
also 
be 
exhibited 
by 
fish 
schools 
(Pitcher 
& 
Parrish, 
1993). 
The 
dynamic 
parallel 
group 
exhibits 
many 
of 
the 
properties 
associated 
with 
aggregations 
such 
as 
bird 
flocks 
and 
fish 
schools; 
the 
individuals 
are 
polarized 
and 
move 
as 
a 
coherent 
group, 
but 
individuals 
can 
move 
throughout 
the 
group 
and 
density 
and 
group 
form 
can 
fluctuate 
(Major 
& 
Dill, 
1978; 
Partridge, 
1982). 
The 
highly 
parallel 
group 
is 
much 
more 
static 
in 
terms 
of 
exchange 
of 
spatial 
positions 
within 
the 
group 
than 
the 
dynamic 
parallel 
group, 
and 
the 
variation 
in 
density 
and 
form 
is 
minimal. 
The 
torus 
formation 
may 
seem 
uncharacteristic 
of 
real 
animal 
movement 
within 
groups. 
However, 
this 
group 
type 
is 
exhibited 
by 
natural 
schools 
of 
fish 
in 
open 
water 
including 
barracuda, 
jack 
and 
tuna 
[see 
Parrish 
& 
Edelstein-Keshet 
(1999) 
for 
a 
photograph 
of 
this 
behaviour 
in 
jack]. 



Fig. 3(E) and (F) show the group polarization 
pgroup and angular momentum mgroup, respectively, 
as Dro and Dra vary. The area of zero 
values when Dro and Dra are relatively low 
[Fig. 3(E) and (F), region e] corresponds to the 
area of parameter space, where groups have a 
greater than 50% chance of fragmenting. Since 
the collective behaviour is dependent on group 
size, analysis is only performed on non-fragmented 
groups. The group types shown in Fig. 3 
exist for all group sizes analysed, although the 
range over which the torus and dynamic parallel 
groups form tends to decrease as the group size 
decreases. The field of perception also influences 
the collective behaviour. The range in which 
groups form a torus is diminished to a very small 
range of Dro and Dra when the field of 
perception, a; is 3601, but increases as a 
decreases. Parallel groups become more elongated 
along their principal axis (the direction of

If 
the

is

the

remain 
largely

the

in

dynamic 
parallel 
groups 
is 
reduced, 
with 
highly 
parallel 
groups 
forming 
at 
relatively 
low 
Dro 
values. 
As 
noise 
is 
increased, 
the 
dynamic

area 
first 
expands 
in 
the 
Dro dimension 
and 
then 
individual 
error 
becomes 
too 
high 
for 
polarized,

group 
types 
to

and 
swarm-like

persists 
over

As 
noise 
increases, 
there 
is 
also 
a 
higher 
probability 
that 
groups 
will 
fragment, 
so 
the 
values 
of 
Dro and 
Dra at 
which 
stable 
groups 
form 
tends 
to 
increase. 


HYSTERESIS 
AND 
BEHAVIOURAL 
TRANSITIONS 


In 
the 
above 
analysis, 
the 
starting 
orientations 
of 
individuals 
are 
always 
random. 
However, 
in 
nature, 
groups 
are 
likely 
to 
move 
between 
collective 
states 
as 
conditions 
change; 
consequently 
the 
previous 
history 
of 
individual 
orientation 
and 
group 
shape 
may 
influence 
future 
collective 
behaviour 
as 
behavioural 
parameters 
change. 
By 
changing 
the 
way 
they 
respond 
to 
others, 
individuals 
can 
change 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
group 
to 
which 
they 
belong. 


To 
investigate 
this 
process, 
we 
explored 
how 
changes 
in 
individual 
behaviour 
result 
in 
a 
change 
of 
the 
collective 
behavioural 
state.

Two

it

Fifteen 
replicates 
were 
performed, 
and 
the 
average

plotted

The

individuals 
within 
the 
group 
modify 
their 
response 
to 
others 
by 
keeping 
ra fixed 
and 
either 
increasing, 
or 
decreasing 
their 
ro over 
a 
given 
range, 
resulting 
in 
the 
group 
changing 
between 
swarm, 
torus 
and 
dynamic 
parallel 
collective 
behaviours. 
If 
ro is 
close 
to 
1 
ðDroE0Þ, 
the 
group 
exhibits 
swarm 
behaviour 
(low 
pgroup, 
low 
mgroup). 
As 
ro increases 
towards 
1.5, 
the 
group 
exhibits 
a 
rapid 
behavioural 
transition 
and 
enters 
the 
torus 
phase 
(mgroup rapidly 
increases). 
Beyond 
2.5, 
however, 
the 
group 
enters 
a 
polarized 
configuration 
(mgroup decreases 
and 
increases). 
However, 
if 
the 
group

pgroup 

moves 
back 
through 
parameter 
space 
in 
the 



opposite direction, decreasing ro, we show that 
the group structure is different. Group polarization 
does not decrease, and angular momentum 
remains low and the group does not adopt the 
torus conformation. As ro decreases below 1.5, 
however, the polarization rapidly disappears 
and the group readopts the swarm configuration. 
This shows that the transition between 
behavioural states depends on the previous 
history (structure) of the group, even though 
individuals have no explicit knowledge of what 
that history is. 
SELF-SORTING 
Differences in individual movement patterns, 
or behavioural motivations, influence the spatial 
positions occupied within a group (Fig. 5). 
Differences in speed s, turning rate y; rr, and ro 
all influence the distribution of individuals 
relative to either, or both, the centre and front 
of groups [Fig. 5(A)–(D)], whereas error s 
influences only that from the front. ra has no 
significant effect. Speed is strongly positively 
correlated with being at the front of the group, 
showing that faster individuals tend to occupy 
positions near the front of moving groups. 
Faster individuals also tend to be further from 
(negatively correlated with) the group centre, 
although this correlation is less strong 
[Fig. 5(A)]. Turning rate is negatively correlated 
with being at the front of the group, and slightly 
positively correlated with being at the group 
centre, demonstrating that individuals with a 
higher rate of turning tend to be at the rear, and 
slightly closer to the centre of the group, than are 
individuals with a lower rate of turning 
[Fig. 5(B)]. The degree of error in individual 
movement is negatively correlated only with 
being at the front of the group, with individuals 
exhibiting higher error occupying positions 
towards the rear of the group. 
Only variation in the zone of repulsion, rr, and 
zone of orientation, ro, influence sorting within

to 
be 
closer 
to 
the 
centre 
and 
front 
of 
the 
group 
than 
do 
individuals 
with 
larger 
rr [Fig. 
5(C) 
and 
(E)]. 
The 
radius 
of 
the 
zone 
of 
orientation, 
ro, 
is 
very 
slightly 
negatively 
correlated 
with 
being 
at 
the 
front 
of 
the 
group 
at 
very 
low 
levels 
of 
variance, 
but 
becomes 
strongly 
positively 
correlated 
as 
the 
variance 
increases. 
Intuitively, 
the 
increase 
in 
orientation 
response 
could 
be 
expected 
to 
positively 
correlate 
with 
being 
in 
frontal 
positions 
since 
such 
individuals 
have 
a 
larger 
range 
over 
which 
they 
align 
to 
others, 
and 
their 
movement 
consequently 
tends 
to 
exhibit 
lower 
deviations 
in 
angle 
from 
the 
direction 
of 
travel 
than 
individuals 
with 
a 
smaller 
ro. 
However, 
currently, 
we 
cannot 
explain 
the 
very 
slight 
negative 
correlation 
between 
ro and 
being 
at 
the 
front 
of 
the 
group 
when 
variation 
in 
ro is 
very 
low. 


For 
all 
parameters 
where 
a 
correlation 
is 
found, 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
correlation 
tends 
to 
increase 
as 
the 
variation 
among 
individuals 
increases. 


Discussion 


Our 
model 
exhibits 
several 
collective 
behaviours, 
with 
sharp 
transitions 
between 
them 
(see 
also 
Suzuki 
& 
Sakai, 
1973 
and 
Shimoyama 
et al., 
1996). 
Small 
changes 
in 
individual 
responses 
result 
in 
large 
changes 
in 
group 
properties 
and 
organization. 
The 
model 
predicts 
that 
animal 
groups, 
such 
as 
fish 
schools, 
change 
rapidly 
between 
these 
states 
(for 
example, 
between 
the 
torus 
and 
dynamic 
parallel 
group 
types) 
since 
intermediate 
group 
types 
are 
relatively 
(dynamically) 
unstable. 
Biologically 
the 
transitions 
are 
important 
in 
allowing 
animal 
groups 
to 
change 
from 
one 
type 
of 
group 
structure 
to 
another 
in 
response 
to 
internal 
(e.g. 
hunger) 
or 
external 


(e.g. 
detection 
of 
a 
predator) 
stimuli, 
as 
individuals 
attempt 
to 
maximize 
their 
fitness 
as 
circumstances 
change. 
The 
tendency 
of 
individuals 
to 
align 
with 
one 
another 
within 
the 
parallel 
group 
types 
is 
important 
not 
only 
in 
minimizing 
collision 
between 
individuals 
and 
facilitating 
group 
movement, 
but 
also 
in 
allowing 
the 
group 
to 
transfer 
information. 
For 
example, 
if 
an 
individual 
were 
to 
turn 
sharply, 
as 
a 
response 
to 
avoiding 
a 
predator 
or 
an 
obstacle, 
the 
alignment 
tendency 
allows 
this 
turn 
to 
influence 
the 
orientation 
of 
neighbours 
(which 
need 
not 
directly 
detect 
the 
stimulus), 
facilitating 
a 
transfer 
of 
information 
(turning) 
over 
a 
range 
greater 
than 
the 
individual 
interaction 
radius. 
If 
individuals 
exhibit 
attraction, 
but 
little 
or 
no 
alignment 
to 
neighbours, 
they 
exhibit 
the 
swarm 
group 
type. 
This 
group 
is 
very 
cohesive, 
but 
the 
relatively 
high 
variance 
of 
individual 
orientation 
means 
that 
the 
change 
in 
direction 
of 
group 
members, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
detecting 
a 
predator 
for 
example, 
is 
propagated 
less 
efficiently. 
The 
torus 
group 
type 
may 
also 
benefit 
from 
the 
local 
(although 
not 
global) 
polarization 
of 
individuals 
in 
allowing 
a 
group 
to 
remain 
relatively 
stationary 
(which 
may 
be 
beneficial 
when 
resting, 
or 
to 
avoid 
encounters 
with 
sit-and-wait 
predators) 
yet 
still 
facilitates 
information 
transmission. 
This 
group 
type 
exhibits 
continual 
motion 
(needed 
by 
certain 
species 
of 
fish 
for 
respiration), 
and 
may 
provide 
energetic 
savings 
as 
a 
result 
of 
individuals 
using 
the 
slipstreams 
of 
others. 


As 
well 
as 
demonstrating 
that 
collective 
behavioural 
transitions 
occur 
in 
our 
model, 
we 
also 
investigated 
the 
way 
such 
transitions 
may 
occur 
in 
natural 
animal 
groups 
as 
a 
result 
of 
individuals 
modifying 
their 
interactions 
with 
one 
another. 
Intuitively, 
one 
may 
assume 
that 
group-living 
animals 
need 
only 
evolve 
a 
direct 
relationship 
between 
internal 
state 
(resulting 
from 
internal 
and 
external 
stimuli) 
and 
behaviour 
(here 
the 
rules 
of 
interaction 
employed). 
However, 
our 
model 
reveals 
that 
two 
very 
different 
collective 
states 
can 
occur 
for 
identical 
individual 
behaviour, 
demonstrating 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
previous 
history 
of 
the 
group 
structure. 
This 
hysteresis 
phenomenon 
is 
an 
important 
result, 
because 
it 
suggests 
that 
the 
evolution 
of 
individual 
behavioural 
responses 
to 
facilitate 
collective 
transitions 
may 
be 
more 
complex 
than 
it 
would 
originally 
appear. 
Understanding 
how 
and 
why 
animal 
groups 
change 
from 
one 
collective 
state 
to 



I. 
D. 
COUZIN 
ET AL. 
another 
is 
essential 
if 
we 
are 
to 
understand 
the 
evolution 
of 
animal 
grouping. 
Such 
collective 
memory 
may 
be 
an 
as 
yet 
undiscovered 
property 
of 
group 
behaviour 
transitions 
in 
animal 
groups 
such 
as 
fish 
schools. 
This 
prediction 
could 
be 
directly 
tested 
for 
fish 
species 
that 
exhibit 
both 
the 
torus 
and 
dynamic 
parallel 
group 
structures. 
Furthermore, 
this 
type 
of 
phenomenon 
may 
exist 
during 
transitions 
between 
collective 
behaviours 
in 
other 
animal 
groups 
as 
individuals 
change 
their 
response 
to 
others. 


We 
also 
used 
the 
model 
to 
investigate 
mechanisms 
underlying 
the 
generation 
and 
maintenance 
of 
spatial 
positioning 
within 
animal 
groups. 
The 
results 
of 
the 
model 
suggest 
that 
behavioural 
and/or 
motivational 
differences 
between 
organisms 
may 
have 
an 
important 
structuring 
influence 
when 
animals 
aggregate. 
Individuals 
may 
change 
their 
position 
relative 
to 
others 
within 
groups 
based 
upon 
internal 
state 
such 
as 
satiation 
level, 
or 
of 
perceived 
risk 
of 
predation. 
For 
example, 
Krause 
(1993) 
in 
a 
study 
of 
schooling 
fish 
(roach, 
Rutilus rutilus), 
demonstrated 
that 
starved 
individuals 
will 
tend 
to 
take 
positions 
near 
the 
front 
of 
the 
school 
more 
often 
than 
will 
those 
that 
are 
satiated. 
This 
is 
likely 
to 
maximize 
the 
resource 
intake 
by 
such 
individuals, 
but 
may 
also 
put 
them 
at 
increased 
risk 
of 
attack 
by 
predators 
(Bumann 
et al., 
1997). 
The 
model 
demonstrates 
several 
potential 
self-organizing 
mechanisms 
(‘‘rules 
of 
thumb’’) 
by 
which 
individuals 
can 
modify 
their 
position 
within 
groups. 
This 
sorting 
depends 
not 
on 
the 
absolute 
values 
of 
the 
parameters, 
but 
rather 
on 
the 
relative 
difference 
between 
individuals. 
For 
example, 
if 
an 
individual 
decreases 
the 
size 
of 
the 
local 
area 
of 
repulsion 
relative 
to 
those 
around 
them, 
it 
will 
move 
towards 
the 
centre 
and 
front 
of 
the 
group, 
even 
if 
it 
has 
no 
knowledge 
of 
where 
it 
is 
within 
the 
group. 
This 
is 
important 
because 
it 
is 
unlikely 
that 
organisms, 
such 
as 
pelagic 
fish 
within 
large 
schools, 
have 
the 
cognitive 
or 
sensory 
capabilities 
to 
determine 
their 
location 
within 
their 
group 
(which 
may 
consist 
of 
hundreds 
of 
thousands, 
or 
even 
millions 
of 
individuals) 
and 
then 
adjust 
their 
position 
relative 
to 
that. 
There 
may 
also 
be 
limits 
to 
the 
information 
available 
to 
grouping 
individuals. 
For 
example, 
the 
average 
distance 
main


tained 
between 
neighbours 
within 
pelagic 
fish 
schools 
is 
usually 
between 
three-tenths 
of 
a 
body 
length 
and 
one 
body 
length 
(Partridge, 
1982), 
and 
it 
is 
extremely 
unlikely 
that 
individuals 
inside 
the 
group 
are 
aware 
of 
their 
position 
relative 
to 
the 
front, 
or 
centre. 
Thus, 
natural 
selection 
is 
likely 
to 
favour 
mechanisms 
such 
that 
individuals 
can 
change 
their 
position 
relative 
to 
others 
based 
only 
on 
local 
information. 
Another 
property 
of 
a 
system 
self-sorted 
in 
this 
way 
is 
that 
if 
individual 
differences 
in 
behaviour 
are 
intrinsic, 
or 
tend 
to 
be 
consistent, 
the 
system 
will 
reassemble 
forming 
(statistically) 
the 
same 
configuration 
after 
perturbation 
from 
that 
state. 
A 
generic 
result 
of 
this 
sorting 
process 
is 
that 
individuals 
with 
similar 
behaviours 
tend 
to 
become 
aggregated 
within 
the 
group. 
In 
many 
fish 
schools, 
individuals 
tend 
to 
be 
close 
to 
other 
individuals 
of 
a 
similar 
size 
(Pitcher 
et al., 
1985; 
Parrish, 
1989; 
DeBlois 
& 
Rose, 
1996). 
This 
mechanism 
may 
also 
underlie 
the 
sorting 
behaviour 
within 
multi-
species 
schools, 
where 
individuals 
have 
been 
found 
to 
assort 
by 
both 
species 
and 
size 
(Parrish, 
1989). 
The 
results 
of 
our 
model 
suggest 
that 
if 
size 
and/or 
species 
is 
correlated 
with 
the 
behavioural 
response, 
or 
the 
movement 
properties 
of 
fish, 
that 
this 
could 
account 
for 
the 
assortment 
seen. 
Modelling 
self-sorting 
may 
also 
be 
valuable 
in 
understanding 
how 
parasites 
manipulate 
the 
positions 
of 
individuals 
within 
groups. 
For 
example, 
Krause 
& 
Godin 
(1994) 
found 
that 
banded 
killifish 
parasitized 
with 
Crassiphiala bulboglossa, 
a 
trematode 
worm, 
will 
tend 
to 
occupy 
peripheral 
positions 
within 
a 
shoal 
of 
unparasitized 
conspecifics 
(see 
also 
Barber 
& 
Huntingford, 
1996 
for 
a 
similar 
host– 
parasite 
system). 
They 
suggest 
that 
the 
parasite 
may 
have 
evolved 
the 
ability 
to 
manipulate 
the 
host 
behaviour. 
Our 
model 
provides 
potential 
mechanisms 
of 
sorting 
that 
may 
help 
experimentalists 
to 
better 
understand 
what 
behavioural 
modification 
occur 
in 
such 
parasitized 
individuals.
