Abstract 


Collective 
behavior 
of 
winged 
insects 
is 
a 
wondrous 
and 
familiar 
phenomenon 
in 
the 
real 
world. 
In 
this 
paper, 
we 
introduce 
a 
highly 
efficient 
field-based 
approach 
to 
simulate 
various 
insect 
swarms. 
Its 
core 
idea 
is 
to 
construct 
a 
smooth 
yet 
noise-aware 
governing 
velocity 
field 
that 
can 
be 
further 
decomposed 
into 
two 
sub-fields: 
(i) 
a 
divergence-free 
curl 
noise 
field 
to 
model 
noise-induced 
movements 
of 
individual 
insects 
in 
a 
swarm, 
and 
(ii) 
an 
enhanced 
global 
velocity 
field 
to 
control 
navigational 
paths 
in 
a 
complex 
environment 
along 
which 
all 
the 
insects 
in 
a 
swarm 
fly. 
Through 
simulation 
experiments 
and 
comparisons 
with 
existing 
crowd 
simulation 
approaches, 
we 
demonstrate 
that 
our 
approach 
is 
effective 
to 
simulate 
various 
insect 
swarm 
behaviors 
including 
aggregation, 
positive 
phototaxis, 
sedation, 
mass-migrating, 
and 
so 
on. 
Besides 
its 
high 
efficiency, 
our 
approach 
is 
very 
friendly 
to 
parallel 
implementation 
on 
GPUs 
(e.g., 
the 
speed-up 
achieved 
through 
GPU 
acceleration 
is 
higher 
than 
50 
if 
the 
number 
of 
simulated 
insects 
is 
more 
than 
ten 
thousands 
on 
an 
off-the-shelf 
computer). 
Our 
approach 
is 
the 
first 
multi-agent 
modeling 
system 
that 
introduces 
curl-noise 
into 
agents’ 
velocity 
field 
and 
uses 
its 
non-scattering 
nature 
to 
maintain 
non-colliding 
movements 
in 
3D 
crowd 
simulation.

of 
various 
insect 
behaviors 
can 
find 
its 
prominent 
use 
in 
many 
scientific 
research 
fields 
including 
but 
not 
limited 
to 
behavioral 
biology, 
zoology, 
bionics, 
multi-agent 
control, 
and 
robotics. 
Among 
various 
insect 
behaviors, 
insect 
swarm 
is 
considered 
as 
one 
of 
widely 
observed 
biological 
motions. 
Generally, 
an 
insect 
swarm 
is 
referred 
to 
a 
group 
of 
individual 
insects 
that 
exhibit 
inherently 
noisy, 
non-colliding 
and 
aggregate 
motion 
[BSC⇤06]. 
The 
term 
inherent 
noise 
in 
zoology 
field 
is 
referred 
to 
all 
the 
random 
movements 
made 
by 
individuals 
in 
an 
insect 
group. 


Over 
the 
years, 
research 
advances 
in 
the 
bionics 
field 
have 
yielded 
plenty 
of 
experimental 
evidence 
and 
insights 
how 
insect 
swarms 
are 
dynamically 
formed 
and 
evolved 
[Mor63, 
RMC95, 
RMD⇤03]. 
For 
example, 
researchers 
revealed 
that 
noise-induced 
movement 
and 
increasing 
the 
randomness 
of 
the 
movements 
in 
response 
to 
a 
loss 
of 
group 
alignment 
are 
intrinsic 
characteristics 
of 
certain 
insect 
swarms 
[BSC⇤06, 
YEE⇤09]. 
These 
findings 
imply, 
besides 
sharing 
group-level 
properties 
like 
other 
animal 
groups, 
individual 
insects 
in 
a 
swarm 
often 
make 
sudden 
changes 
in 
direction 
spontaneously. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
existing 
biological 
experimental 
findings 
(e.g., 
[STD74]) 
validated 
that 
the 
compound 
eye 
structure 
of 
insects 
makes 
them 
react 
fast 
to 
the 
things 
surrounded 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
predators 
or 
hit 
obstacles 
in 
the 
environment. 
This 
implies 
that 
regardless 
level 
of 
the 
random 
movements 
of 
an 
insect, 
it 
can 
fly 
as 
safely 
as 
possible 
in 
a 
dense 
swarm 
or 
in 
a 
complex 
environment. 
As 
understanding 
insect 
swarms 
becomes 
more 
and 
more 
prominent 
in 
many 
scientific 
fields, 
developing 
effective 
algorithms 
to 
simulate 
realistic 
large-scale 
insect 
swarms 
is 
clearly 
a 
priority. 
Indeed, 
no 
sound 
computer 
modeling 
approaches 
for 
such 
simulations 
have 
been 
developed 
and 
validated 
to 
date. 


Likewise, 
existing 
crowd 
simulation 
techniques 
often 
fall 
short 
of 
simulating 
insect 
swarms 
effectively. 
The 
above 
characteristics 
of 
insect 
swarms 
can 
be 
summarized 
as 
follows: 


Noise-induced 
movements: 
Since 
humans 
and 
large 
animals 
typically 
move 
in 
a 
trajectory 
of 
gradual 
changes, 
most 
of 
existing 
crowd 
techniques 
focus 
on 
generating 
smooth 
paths 
or 
tend 
to 
add 
small 
variations 
[Rey87] 
to 
increase 
naturalness. 
But 
in 
the 
case 
of 
simulation 
of 
insect 
swarms, 
their 
paths 
are 
dominated 
by 
noise. 
Each 
insect 
in 
a 
swarm 
can 
move 
somewhat 
freely. 
Simple 
noise 
fails 
to 
create 
realistic 
swarms, 
which 
implies 
an 
appropriate 
noise 
function 
needs 
to 
be 
delicately 
designed 
for 
such 
simulations. 


Non-colliding 
rapid 
movements: 
It 
is 
difficult 
to 
simulate 
large-scale 
random 
movements 
while 
avoiding 
collisions 
in 
previous 
frameworks. 
For 
example, 
rule-based 
crowd 
simulation 
approaches 
[Rey87, 
Rey99], 
social 
force 
models 
[HM95, 
PAB07], 
and 
continuum-based 
approaches 
[TCP06] 
need 
to 
advance 
for 
several 
time 
steps 
to 
find 
out 
non-collide 
velocities/positions. 
Since 
rapid 
movements 
are 
difficult 
to 
predict 
in 
advance, 
simply 
adding 
rapid 


random 
movements 
to 
these 
works 
may 
fail 
to 
avoid 
most 
collisions. 
Meanwhile, 
without 
considerable 
efforts, 
it 
is 
extremely 
difficult 
to 
directly 
apply 
example-based 
(or 
data-
driven) 
approaches 
[LCHL07] 
for 
insect 
swarm 
simulation 
due 
to 
the 
technical 
difficulty 
of 
accurately 
tracking 
rapid 
moving 
individual 
insects 
in 
a 
swarm 
within 
various 
natural 
environments. 


Inspired 
by 
the 
above 
challenges, 
in 
this 
paper 
we 
present 
a 
highly 
efficient 
field-based 
approach 
to 
realistically 
simulate 
behavior 
patterns 
of 
insect 
swarms 
under 
various 
scenarios. 
Specifically, 
we 
formulate 
this 
simulation 
problem 
as 
a 
mesoscopic 
multi-agent 
system 
that 
models 
both 
macroscopic 
goal-attained 
path 
planning 
and 
microscopic 
behaviors 
(e.g., 
individual 
space, 
random 
switching 
and 
local 
collision 
avoidance). 
Through 
simulation 
experiments 
and 
comparisons 
with 
existing 
crowd 
simulation 
approaches, 
we 
demonstrate 
that 
our 
inherent 
noise-aware 
insect 
swarm 
simulation 
approach 
can 
be 
effectively 
used 
to 
simulate 
various 
realistic 
behaviors 
of 
insect 
swarms 
including 
aggregation, 
positive 
phototaxis, 
sedation, 
mass-migrating, 
and 
so 
on. 


The 
contributions 
of 
this 
work 
are: 
(i) 
a 
simple 
divergence-free 
noise 
field 
to 
govern 
a 
series 
of 
noise-aware 
yet 
non-colliding 
motions, 
which 
is 
highly 
similar 
to 
rapid 
transitions 
that 
result 
from 
disordered 
yet 
noise-induced 
movements 
of 
individual 
insects 
in 
a 
swarm, 
and 
(ii) 
an 
enhanced 
global 
velocity 
field 
for 
parallel 
implementation 
to 
control 
navigational 
paths 
especially 
in 
a 
complex 
environment 
along 
which 
all 
the 
insects 
in 
a 
swarm 
fly. 


To 
the 
best 
of 
our 
knowledge, 
our 
approach 
is 
the 
first 
multi-agent 
modeling 
system 
that 
introduces 
curl-noise 
into 
agents’ 
velocity 
field 
and 
uses 
its 
non-scattering 
nature 
of 
the 
resulting 
field 
to 
maintain 
noise-aware 
yet 
non-colliding 
movements 
in 
3D 
crowd 
simulation. 
The 
research 
described 
in 
this 
paper 
represents 
some 
promising 
first 
steps 
toward 
realistic 
simulation 
of 
various 
3D 
crowds 
in 
virtual 
worlds 
based 
on 
the 
collective 
knowledge 
developed 
in 
behavioral 
biology 
and 
other 
scientific 
fields.

A 
variety 
of 
approaches 
for 
modeling 
motion 
of 
multiple 
agents 
in 
a 
crowd 
have 
been 
proposed 
during 
the 
past 
decades. 
They 
can 
be 
roughly 
classified 
into 
three 
categories, 
broadly 
termed 
microscopic, 
macroscopic 
and 
mesoscopic 
[ZMR⇤08]. 
Microscopic 
models 
regard 
agents

handle 
a

mesoscopic

of 
the

two.

perceptual knowledge of pedestrians [ST05], cognitive modeling 
[FTT99], or egocentric affordance fields [KSHF09]. 
Helbing and Molnar [HM95] pioneered the social force 
model for simulating pedestrian motion such as repulsive interaction, 
friction forces, dissipation, and fluctuations. Later, 
it was further applied and generalized to other simulation 
scenarios such as densely populated crowds [PAB07]. 
Macroscopic or continuous models are often used when 
the task is to compute a crowd’s path towards its goal 
such as a navigation graph [PvdBC⇤11]. Flow tiles and 
potential field-based models regard the environment as a 
regular discrete grid, then gradient methods can be applied 
to find a path from any start position to a destination in 
an environment [NGCL09]. However, this approach creates 
incompressible, dense and flow-like crowds. When noise is 
blended into a compressive flow, the noise component will 
always be lost during the solving of the incompressible flow 
(i.e., the UIC projecting process). In addition, interactive 
path planning and navigation algorithms for multi-agent systems 
in complex dynamic environments were also proposed 
[SAC⇤08,KOOP11,JXW⇤08]. 
Mesoscopic models can govern local behaviors of agents 
while navigating a goal-directed path of the crowd. Researchers 
have introduced continuum theory [TCP06, 
SWL11], information theory [GvdBL⇤12], and synthetic 
vision [OPOD10] into crowd simulation domain. Goldenstein 
et al. [GKM⇤01a, GKM⇤01b] employ a three-layer 
hybrid system for agent steering and crowd simulation. 
Narain and colleagues [NGCL09] further introduced unilateral 
incompressibility constraints to simulate extremely 
dense crowds. However, most of these mesoscopic models 
cannot be directly applied to simulate noise-aware position 
changes that result from spontaneous direction switching 
within an insect swarm, due to their strict requirement of 
local collision avoidances. Note that the method described in 
this paper can be classified as a mesoscopic model as well. 
Example-based (or data-driven) approaches learn crowd 
behavior features from real-world examples [LCHL07, 
CSJ13], and then these features can be used to train statistical 
models for crowd simulation. Researchers also explored 
novel ways to animate large-scale crowds by cloning crowd 
motions from existing examples [LCS⇤12], blending crowd 
animations [JCP⇤10], and diversifying the perceived realism 
of agent motions in a context-aware way [GD11a]. Recently, 
significant efforts have been attracted to generate group formations 
in simulated crowds, including: combining heuristic 
rules with explicit hard constraints to produce and control 
sophisticated group formations [TYK⇤09] or introducing 
a novel sketching interface to specify and control various 
group formations [GD11b, GD13]. Besides, significant interests 
have been drawn to study real collective animal 
groups [BJCC⇤97, SASBJ11] or learn complex patterns in 
specific swarms [TB04,BKBS13].

Figure 2: Schematic view of our introduced inherent noiseaware 
insect swarm simulation approach. 
As illustrated in Figure 2, our approach can be conceptually 
regarded as a two-step computing process. At the preprocessing 
step, we generate a noise field ~N that stores a 3D 
procedural noise function using the well-known Perlin noise 
algorithm [Per02], and a minimum cost field C that stores 
a scalar path-planning cost function, computed based on a 
given environment with obstacles and specified goal positions. 
Then, at the simulation step, we continuously update 
the positions and orientations of all the agents (insects) in 
a swarm based on the velocities provided via ~N and C, 
while ensuring collision avoidances with other agents and 
obstacles in the environment. 
Our approach employs potential fields to produce continuous 
velocity fields spanning free space in the environment. 
The processing and computation of potential fields requires 
3D discretization of the free space in the environment. For 
simplicity, we use regular grids with values stored in cells 
for each potential field and assume that the cells form 
a 6-connected component. It is noteworthy that the two 
potential fields can be defined with respect to grids with 
different resolutions; typically, the noise field needs a higher 
resolution grid for the sake of simulating high-fidelity noise 
motion. 
4. Computing Noise Field 
As documented in the literature, insects’ random movements 
exhibit the same patterns with both large and small variations 
[BHR10]; on the other hand, collision avoidance is one 
of intrinsic flight behaviors for insects in a swarm [YEE⇤09]. 
Thus, the well-known Perlin noise algorithm [Per02] is a 
suitable scheme for modeling such continuous movements. 
Specifically, we first define a randomly varying vector 
constructed from the Perlin noise as follows: 
~P = 
✓
P1
⇣ ~x 
scale
⌘
,P2
⇣ ~x 
scale
⌘
,P3
⇣ ~x 
scale
⌘◆
⇤gain, 
where ~x(x, y, z) is a point in 3D space, and P1,P2,P3 are 
three Perlin noise functions with different random seeds 
to generate scalar noise values in the range of [-1.0, 1.0]

(defined with respect to a unit of grid), respectively. We 
use two noise parameters, scale (for controlling the grid 
density indirectly) and gain (for adjusting the magnitude of 
the Perlin noise). 
Then, based on the obtained ~P, we further construct 
a divergence-free noise field ~Vl , inspired by the work of 
Bridson et al. [BHN07] that introduced an incompressible 
flow field modulated by a curl operator r⇥: 
~Vl = r⇥(a1y1 +a2y2 +. . .+anyn) 
= r⇥~N. (1) 
Here the noise field ~N can be formed through the addition of 
a number of potential fields, yni
=1. Since the divergence of 
the curl of any vector field is always zero: r·r⇥ ⌘ 0, the 
velocity field~Vl is divergence-free (i.e.,r·~Vl =0) [BHN07]. 
The divergence-free noise field can be treated as a collisionfree 
field in a multi-agent model since any two particles in 
this incompressible field will never intersect. In this work, 
we treat insects as discrete particles and drive them using ~Vl 
to obtain collision-free trajectories. 
The simplest way to construct ~N would be to define 
~N = ~P. However, ~P is too random to express a non-colliding 
velocity field. In fact, Bridson et al. [BHN07] introduced 
a number of formulas to construct ~N and provided several 
examples. One of them is well suited to our purpose: Consider 
there are some static boundaries in the environment, 
and insects are not allowed to go through the boundaries 
(that is, the insects’ velocities at the boundaries must satisfy 
the following condition: ~Vl ·~n = 0). Its specific construction 
formula is described as follows: 
~N = a~P+(1−a)(~n ·~P)~n, (2) 
where ~n is the normal to the boundary surface, and 
a=a(d(~x)/d0) (0  a  1) is a smooth ramp function. In 
this ramp function, d(~x) is the shortest distance from a point 
~x(x, y, z) to the boundaries, and d0 is an adjustment factor. In 
our case, d0 is set to be equivalent to the side length of the 
grid. The closer~x is to the boundaries, the larger value a has. 
The boundaries can be used not only to keep insects out of 
obstacles (accurate boundaries) but also to avoid them flying 
too far away (extended boundaries that are much larger than 
the swarm). 
Eq. 2 implies that the tangential component of ~P is 
reduced near the boundaries, but the normal component is 
retained. In this way, the curl of ~N will remove the velocity 
in the normal direction gradually as approaching to the 
boundary surface. In this work, a suitable ramp function a 
is defined as follows (similar to [BHN07]): 
a(r) = 
⇢ 38
r5− 10 
8 r3 + 15 
8r r 1; 
1 otherwise. 
(3) 
In Eq. 3, r implies d(~x)/d0 and should never be negative. 
We employ the above ~Vl (Eq. 1) to simulate local behaviors 
of individual insects in a swarm. Figure 3 shows a 
Figure 3: An example of ~Vl showing how the ramp function 
removes the velocity component in the normal direction. 
velocity field generated from Eqs. 1 and 2. In addition, we 
can also use dynamic P that varies over time to make insects 
who pass a specific spot have different velocities. But it will 
take extra computational time when updating every frame. 
In practice, we found it unnoticeable that insects pass one 
spot are doing the same thing. So a fixed P is enough for 
our algorithm. From our experiments, we found this scheme 
is suitable for modeling noise behaviors of insect swarms, 
compared with observed real-world insect swarms. 
5. Computing Minimum Cost Field 
Besides noisy local behaviors of individual insects, we also 
need to script a swarm’s path by building migratory urge into 
our model. Not only this is a common phenomenon existing 
in real-world insect swarms (e.g., migration, foraging, or 
attacking), it also allows users to conveniently control goaldirected 
swarms in simulation. 
Given an environment description with specified goal 
areas and obstacles, computing a goal-directed velocity field 
means that there should be at least one valid path from 
each cell in free space to the goal area. For simplicity, 
we assume that each insect has knowledge of the whole 
environment, and it typically selects an as-short-as-possible 
path. Therefore, we choose to use a variant of the Dijkstra’s 
shortest path algorithm to construct a minimum cost field C. 
In this work, the total cost of a path from a cell to the goal 
area is determined by two factors: the path’s total length and 
the total value of repulsion along the path. A position closer 
to obstacles typically has a higher value of repulsion, and 
vice versa. In this way, finding an optimal path is equivalent 
to minimize the following cost function: 
Cost = A 
Z
P 
1ds 
| {z } 
pathlength
+B 
Z
P 
gds, 
| {z } 
repulsion 
(4) 
where A and B are weights of individual terms, g stands for 
the value of repulsion, and ds denotes that this integral is

taken with respect to path length. In the above equation, the 
higher the B value is (i.e., the lower the A value is), the more 
dangerous the obstacles are. In our simulation experiments, 
we empirically set the values of A and B to 0.6 and 0.4, 
respectively. In follow-up Section 5.1, we will describe 
how the obstacles are expressed as a grid of repulsion, and 
describe how to solve the cost field C in Section 5.2. 
5.1. Space Analysis 
In an exterior scene, typically there are buildings, facilities, 
and other landscapes. They are called obstacles in a path 
finding algorithm. When insects approach the boundaries 
of the obstacles (termed the area of repulsion), they need 
to adjust their speeds and orientations to avoid collisions. 
Each cell in the area of repulsion is assigned with a value of 
repulsion. In this way, a swarm can find a smooth and safe 
path to pass by the obstacles. Without loss of generality, in 
this writing we assume the obstacles are represented as (or 
can be converted to) 3D triangular meshes. 
The following two conditions can be used to determine 
whether a 3D grid cell is in the area of repulsion. 
• The center of the grid cell lies inside one of the obstacles 
or just on the obstacles’ surface; 
• The center of the grid cell lies outside the obstacles, but 
its shortest distance to one of the obstacles is smaller than 
a user-specified threshold. 
The shortest distance between a 3D grid cell X and the 
obstacles determines whether X is in the area of repulsion. 
In our approach, we employ a signed-distance computation 
algorithm proposed by Baerentzen and Aanaes [BA05] to 
compute such shortest distances due to its efficiency. Specifically, 
assuming dt (X) denotes the shortest distance from X 
to the obstacles, the signed distance f(X) between X and its 
closest obstacle (mesh) is computed as follows: 
f(X) = 
⇢ 
−dt (X) if X is inside an obstacle; 
dt (X) otherwise. (5) 
To the end, the value of repulsion of the cell X, 
g(X), can be computed by using a bell-shaped function 
from [WMW86] as follows: 
g(X)=h(r)=
8< 
: 
1 r < 0; 
1−( 4
9 )r6 +(17 
9 )r4−( 22 
9 )r2 0  r  1; 
0 r > 1. 
(6) 
In Eq. 6, r = f(X) 
2a , and a = p2l denotes the diagonal 
length of a regular grid (l is the side length). Figure 4(a) plots 
the repulsive function (Eq. 6) and illustrates an example of 
the computed signed distances of a discretized space. 
5.2. Solving Minimum Cost Field 
On top of the above obtained area of repulsion, we need to 
further define a minimum cost field C. We can rewrite the

examples of signed distances. (b) The corresponding solved

above cost function (Eq. 4) as the following discrete form: 
krC(X) k=4g(X)+l, (7) 
where g(X) denotes the value of repulsion at cell X, and l 
is the known side length of a cell. Note that the above Eq. 
7 is an eikonal equation; its solved optimized paths exactly 
follow the gradient of C, which gives us a global velocity 
field ~Vg [TCP06]. 
Suggested by Treuille et al. [TCP06], we also use the fast 
marching method [Set96] to solve C in Eq. 7. Its solving 
process can be conceptually regarded as a variant of the 
Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm. For more details about 
the solver, please refer to the work of [Set96,TCP06] . After 
the minimum cost field C is solved, we can obtain a smooth 
global velocity field ~Vg by taking the gradient direction of C 
and scaling it by insect speed s0, described as follows: 
~Vg(X) = −rC(X) 
krC(X) k ·s0. (8) 
Note that in our algorithm s0 is a user-specified parameter, 
and its value depends on the species of insects and specific 
simulation scenarios. Figure 4(b) shows an example of the 
solved smooth global velocity field. As illustrated in this 
figure, since every grid cell has at least one neighbor with 
a minimum cost, there is no local minimum in the solved 
cost field. In other words, agents (insects) will always find 
a valid path to the goal area, instead of getting stuck in the 
middle. 
The main differences between the original potential field 
model in Continuum Crowds [TCP06] and our approach 
are: First, our approach can handle 3D complex simulation 
environment which is not provided in the original model, 
since a compact description of the 3D environment instead 
of simply adding discomfort values to grids (as in the original 
model) is very important in insect swarm simulation.

Second, 
we 
compute 
the 
desired 
cost 
field 
and 
curl-noise 
field 
just 
once 
(or 
when 
the 
environment 
changes) 
as 
a 
preprocessing 
step, 
without 
updating 
them 
every 
simulating 
frame. 
Because 
of 
this, 
the 
simulation 
rate 
of 
our 
approach 
only 
depends 
on 
the 
number 
of 
insects. 
Note 
that 
it 
is 
extremely 
slow 
if 
we 
directly 
use 
the 
original 
potential 
field 
model 
to 
simulate 
such 
a 
large-scale 
swarm 
(more 
than 
10k 
agents). 
Third, 
our 
approach 
could 
be 
highly 
paralleled 
when 
implemented 
on 
GPU. 
The 
analysis

are 
discussed

To 
the 
end, 
we 
combine 
the 
two 
velocity 
fields: 
the 
local 
velocity 
(noise) 
field 
(Eq. 
1) 
and 
the 
global 
velocity 
field 
(Eq.

an

and

Minimum 
distance 
enforcement: 
Unfortunately, 
our 
global 
velocity 
field 
Vg 
is 
not 
as 
incompressible 
as 
Vl 
. 
When

~~ 


the 
moving 
of 
the 
agents 
is 
governed 
by 
Eq. 
9, 
artifacts 
may 
occur, 
which 
is 
caused 
by 
the 
intersection 
or 
overlapping 
of 
different 
agents 
(insects), 
especially 
at 
corners 
of 
obstacles 
(refer 
to 
Figure 
5(a)). 
We 
address 
this 
issue 
by 
employing 
a 
Minimum 
Distance 
Enforcement 
(MDE) 
rule 
after 
every 
insect’s 
position 
has 
been 
updated, 
as 
suggested 
by 
Treuille 
et 
al. 
[TCP06]. 
This 
rule 
can 
be 
briefly 
described 
as 
follows: 
If 
the 
distance 
between 
two 
agents 
are 
smaller 
than 
a 
threshold 
(i.e., 
the 
minimum 
distance), 
we 
push 
them 
apart. 
To 
enforce 
the 
minimum 
distance 
between 
any 
insect 
pair, 
once 
the 
locations 
of 
all 
the 
agents 
are 
updated 
at 
each 
simulation 
step, 
we 
iterate 
all 
the 
pairs 
of 
agents 
in 
the 
same 
cell 
to 
identify 
near-collision 
pairs 
(i.e., 
pairwise 
distance 
is 
smaller 
than 
a 
minimum-distance 
threshold), 
and 
then 
perform 
pairwise 
separations 
on 
them. 
Figure 
5 
illustrates 
an 
example 
of 
minimum 
distance 
enforcement. 
In 
addition, 


the 
minimum 
distance 
enforcement 
rule 
cannot 
absolutely 
avoid 
collisions 
but 
it 
has 
a 
reduced 
linear 
time 
complexity 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
dimensions 
of 
the 
grid. 
In 
this 
regard, 
it 
is 
a 
sound 
computational 
trade-off. 


In 
sum, 
given 
a 
3D 
environment 
description, 
the 
starting 
area(s), 
and 
the 
goal 
area(s), 
our 
approach 
can 
automatically 
compute 
smooth 
yet 
noise-aware 
insect 
trajectories 
without 
collisions. 
Note 
that 
the 
starting 
area(s) 
and 
the 
goal 
area(s) 
can 
be 
overlapped 
in 
our 
approach.

7. 
Experimental 
Results 
and 
Evaluation 
We 
performed 
simulation 
experiments 
to 
evaluate 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
our 
approach. 
Several 
selected 
simulation 
scenarios 
are 
described 
below. 
For 
animation 
results, 
please 
refer 
to 
the 
companion 
video. 


Two 
blocks: 
Figure 
6 
shows 
an 
environment 
consisting 
of 
two 
blocks 
that 
form 
a 
narrow 
3D 
passage. 
An 
insect 
swarm 
at 
one 
side 
of 
the 
blocks 
flies 
to 
the 
other 
side 
by 
passing 
through 
the 
passage. 
In 
this 
case, 
congestion 
may 
happen 
at 
the 
entrance 
of 
the 
passage, 
but 
the 
governing 
velocity 
field 
computed 
by 
our 
approach 
can 
effectively 
guide 
the 
swarm 
to 
fly 
along 
a 
flow-like 
path. 
With 
the 
same 
environment, 
another 
simulation 
scenario 
is 
to 
let 
all 
the 
insects 
in 
a 
swarm 
to 
fly 
along 
their 
minimum 
cost 
paths, 
regardless 
passing 
through 
the 
blocks 
or 
flying 
outside 
the 
blocks. 
Figure 
7 
shows 
snapshots 
of 
its 
simulation 
result. 


Chasing: 
In 
this 
simulation, 
an 
insect 
swarm 
continuously 
chases 
a 
target 
ball 
that 
is 
dynamically 
manipulated 
by 
users. 
When 
the 
position 
of 
the 
target 
(ball) 
is 
changed, 
the 
minimum 
cost 
field 
is 
recomputed 
by 
our 
approach. 
The 
ball 
is 
also 
regarded 
as 
a 
boundary 
condition 
used 
in 
Eq. 
2. 
Snapshots 
of 
the 
simulation 
result

Based 
on

(Eq.

insects

generating

insect 
swarms

our 
approach 
can 
be 
directly

to

Aggregation: 
Aggregation 
behaviors 
can 
often 
be 
observed 
on 
many 
gregarious 
insects. 
Insect 
aggregation 
is 
typically 
interpreted 
as 
a 
defense 
behavior; 
thus, 
individuals 
that 
stray 
from 
swarms 
have 
an 
increased 
risk 
from 
predation 
[Vul90]. 
Figure

insects 
by 
our 
approach 
(Note

are 
the

vortex-like

behavior, 
induced 
by 
inherent 
noise 
of 
insects 
[SESG08], 
can 
be 
soundly 
simulated 
by 
our 
approach.

underlying 
mechanisms 
still 
remain 
to 
be 
scientifically 
uncovered 
[MH10]. 
To 
simulate 
it 
using 
our 
approach, 
we 
first 
initialized 
the

centered 
on 
a

and 
then 
probabilistically 
added 
a

Migratory 
locusts: 
One 
major 
distinction 
of 
our 
approach 
is 
its 
scalability 
of 
efficiently 
simulating 
large-scale 
insect 
swarms. 
To 
demonstrate 
it, 
we 
created 
a 
swarm 
of 
5000 
locusts 
on 
a 
120 
⇥ 
50 
⇥ 
55 
grid 
(refer 
to 
Figure 
1(a)). 
The 
swarm 
moves 
forward 
in 
a 
coordinated 
way 
while 
avoiding 
obstacles 
in 
the 
environment, 
as 
demonstrated 
in 
the 
companion

To 
validate 
the 
curl-noise 
model 
is 
a 
sound 
choice 
for 
simulating 
insect 
swarms, 
we 
performed 
the

We

Perlin 
noise

random 
noise

Reynold’s 
Boids 
model 
[Rey87, 
Rey99] 
and 
the 
continuum 
crowds 
model 
[TCP06], 
respectively. 
Then, 
we 
side-by-side 
compare 
the 
results 
with 
our 
curl-
noise 
based 
simulation 
results. 
(2) 
We 
also 
blend 
Perlin 
noise 
and 
random 
noise 
into 
our 
insect 
swarm 
simulation 
algorithm 
(that 
is, 
replacing 
the 
curl-noise 
component 
with 
Perlin 
or 
random 
noise), 
respectively. 
Then, 
we 
side-by-side 
compare 
the 
results 
with 
original 
curl-noise 
based 
simulation 
results.

7.2. 
Performance 
Analysis 
We 
implemented 
our 
approach 
in 
C++. 
All 
our 
experiments 
were 
performed 
on 
an 
off-the-shelf 
computer 
with 
an 
Intel 
2 
Duo 
CPU 
E7500 
and 
4GB 
memory. 
The 
performance 
statistics 
of 
the 
above 
described 
scenarios 
are 
summarized 
in 
Table 
1. 
Its 
preprocessing 
time 
shows 
the 
computing 
time 
to 
calculate 
the 
two 
velocity 
fields 
(except 
the 
chasing 
case, 
the 
average 
time 
per 
user 
manipulation 
is 
indicated), 
measured 
in 
seconds. 
Its 
simulation 
FPS 
shows 
the 
average 
time 
to 
update 
all 
the 
agents’ 
positions 
per 
frame 
using 
CPU 
and 
GPU, 
respectively. 
The 
obtained 
performance 
results 


indicate 
that 
besides 
its 
high 
efficiency, 
our 
approach 
is 
very 
friendly 
to 
parallel 
implementation 
on 
GPUs. 
In 
particular, 
when 
the 
number 
of 
simulated 
insects 
is 
more 
than 
ten 
thousands, 
the 
achieved 
GPU 
speedup 
is 
typically 
more 
than 
50. 


We 
take 
the 
#5 
scenario 
(i.e., 
the 
migratory 
locusts 
simulation) 
in 
the 
above 
Table 
1 
as 
a 
specific 
example 
to 
further 
analyze 
how 
various 
factors 
(e.g., 
the 
number 
of 
insects, 
the 
dimensions 
of 
the 
grid, 
and 
the 
complexity 
of 
the 
obstacle 
meshes) 
affect 
the 
performance 
of 
our 
approach. 
Figure 
14(a) 
plots 
the 
performances 
of 
the 
locusts 
scenario 
with 
varied 
resolutions 
of 
the 
grid 
and 
different 
numbers 
of 
the 
facets 
on 
the 
obstacle 
meshes. 
It 
provides 
experimental 
evidence 
that 
the 
computing 
time 
for 
the 
preprocessing 
part 
in 
our 
approach 
highly 
depends 
on 
the 
complexity 
of 
the 
obstacle 
meshes 
(i.e., 
the 
number 
of 
facets), 
but 
less 
sensitive 
to 
the 
dimensions 
of 
the 
employed 
grid. 
We 
also 
plotted 
simulation 
time 
of 
the 
locusts 
scenario 
with 
varied 
numbers 
of 
insects, 
as 
shown 
in 
Figure 
14(b). 
The 
result 
shows 
that 
the 
runtime 
efficiency 
of 
our 
method 
has 
an 
approximately 
linear 
relation 
to 
the 
number 
of 
simulated 
insects, 
but 
it 
is 
independent 
of 
the 
complexity 
of 
the 
obstacle 
meshes 
and 
the 
dimensions 
of 
the 
used 
grid. 
As 
illustrated 
in 
Figure 
14(b), 
compared 
with 
the 
CPU 
time 
(implemented 
in 
a 
single 
core, 
SIMD 
way), 
the 
achieved 
GPU 
speedup 
is 
more 
prominent 
when 
the 
number 
of 
simulated 
insects 
is 
increased 
(In 
our 
case, 
we 
have 
128 
threads 
per 
block 
so 
the 
speedup 
is 
insignificant 
when 
the 
swarm 
is 
small). 
E.g., 
when 
the 
number 
of 
simulated 
insects 
is 
256K, 
its 
GPU 
speedup 
is 
higher 
than 
125. 
Note 
that 
such 
a 
speedup 
is 
impossible 
to 
achieve 
by 
the 
Continuum 
Crowds 
approach 
[TCP06] 
since 
it 
has 
to 
calculate 
the 
potential 
field 
per 
frame.

Discussion 
and 
Conclusions 
In 
this 
paper, 
we 
introduce 
a 
highly 
efficient 
approach 
to 
simulate 
various 
inherent 
noise-aware 
insect 
swarms. 
Through 
various 
simulation 
experiments, 
we 
demonstrate 
that 
our 
approach 
can 
be 
effectively 
used 
to 
simulate 
a 
variety 
of 
insect 
swarms 
existing 
in 
the 
real 
world 
such 
as 
swarms 
near 
an 
attractive 
source 
or 
towards 
a 
moving 
target, 
aggregation 
swarms, 
positive 
phototaxis, 
migratory 
locusts, 
and 
so 
on. 
However, 
due 
to 
the 
technical 
difficulty 
of 
acquiring 
large-scale 
ground-truth 
data, 
we 
are 
not 
able 
to 
rigorously 
evaluate 
our 
approach. 
We 
only 
did 
qualitative 
evaluations 
by 
visually 
comparing 
the 
simulated 
results 
with 
observed 
insect 
swarms 
in 
the 
real 
world. 


Our 
approach 
is 
highly 
efficient; 
with 
GPU 
implementation 
it 
can 
simulate 
insect 
swarms 
in 
real-time 
with 
more 
than 
256K 
insects 
on 
an 
off-the-shelf 
computer. 
Our 
experimental 
results 
indicate 
that 
the 
runtime 
efficiency 
of 
our 
method 
has 
an 
approximately 
linear 
relation 
to 
the 
number 
of 
simulated 
insects, 
but 
it 
is 
independent 
of 
the 
complexity 
of 
obstacle 
meshes 
and 
dimensions 
of 
the 
grid. 
Not 
limited 
to 
graphics 
and 
animation 
applications, 
our 
approach 
can 
find 
its 
potential 
applications 
in 
other 
fields 
such 
as 
artificial 
intelligence, 
multi-agent 
system 
modeling, 
robot 
control, 
behavioral 
biology, 
and 
so 
on. 


As 
an 
early 
approach 
to 
simulate 
3D 
insect 
swarms, 
our 
current 
approach 
has 
the 
following 
limitations. 


First, 
our 
current 
approach 
does 
not 
take 
the 
body 
size 
of 
individual 
insects 
into 
consideration, 
although 
the 
body 
size 
of 
any 
real 
insect 
is 
non-zero. 
However, 
since 
the 
speed 
of 
an 
insect 
is 
much 
more 
larger, 
compared 
to 
its 
body 
size; 


our 
current 
approach 
can 
practically 
handle 
this 
situation, 
as 
demonstrated 
in 
our 
experiments. 
To 
simulate 
certain 
insects 
with 
relatively 
low 
speeds 
and 
large 
body 
sizes 
(e.g., 
dragonflies), 
our 
current 
approach 
needs 
to 
be 
extended 
by 
efficiently 
detecting 
and 
handling 
body 
collisions 
between 
insects 
as 
well 
as 
modifying 
the 
used 
partial 
differential 
velocity 
solver 
accordingly. 
We 
leave 
it 
to 
the 
future 
work. 



Figure 
15: 
A 
simulation 
snapshot: 
insects 
fly 
densely 
around 
a 
sharp 
obstacle 
while 
other 
regions 
are 
populated 
with 
fewer 
insects. 


Second, 
we 
take 
computation 
of 
the 
minimum 
cost 
field 
as 
a 
preprocessing 
module, 
so 
change 
of 
the 
swarm 
density 
is 
not 
considered. 
As 
shown 
in 
Figure 
15, 
insects 
fly 
densely 
around 
a 
sharp 
obstacle 
while 
other 
regions 
are 
populated 
with 
fewer 
insects. 
This 
is 
a 
limitation 
of 
our 
current 
algorithm, 
because 
we 
assume 
every 
agent 
will 
move 
along 
its 
optimal 
path; 
but 
the 
optimal 
paths 
of 
the 
agents 
are 
not 
evenly 
distributed 
within 
certain 
3D 
environments. 
A 
sound 
solution 
would 
be 
to 
consider 
the 
density 
as 
a 
factor 
and 
recompute 
the 
minimum 
cost 
field 
at 
every 
simulating 
step, 
as 
suggested 
by 
Treuille 
et 
al. 
[TCP06]; 
however, 
unlike 
human 
beings, 
insects 
could 
easily 
form 
a 
large 
swarm 
consisting 
of 
thousands 
of 
individuals. 
Thus, 
such 
real-time 
field 
recomputing 
for 
insect 
swarms 
would 
impose 
a 
greater 
challenge 
than 
the 
work 
of 
[TCP06]. 
As 
a 
future 
work, 
we 
plan 
to 
handle 
this 
issue 
by 
considering 
additional 
factors 
in

the 
preprocessing 
module 
or 
defining 
a 
flow 
field 
through 
the 
density 
of 
swarm 
on 
GPUs. 


Third, 
although 
several 
goals 
and 
swarms 
can 
be 
supported 
in 
the 
domain, 
they 
all 
share 
one 
Eikonal 
Equation. 
Therefore, 
every 
simulated 
insect 
will 
choose 
the 
least-cost 
goal 
instead 
of 
the 
specified 
goal. 
Our 
current 
model 
cannot 
simulate 
multi-swarm 
interaction 
behaviors. 
For 
instance, 
our 
current 
approach 
cannot 
effectively 
simulate 
two 
insect 
swarms 
that 
fly 
through 
each 
other 
in 
opposite 
directions. 


Fourth, 
our 
current 
approach 
does 
not 
provide 
sufficient 
interactive 
user 
controls. 
For 
example, 
it 
does 
not 
provide 
a 
tool 
to 
conveniently 
edit 
resultant 
potential 
fields; 
thus, 
it 
is 
non-trivial 
for 
users 
to 
directly 
control 
behaviors 
of 
certain 
insects 
in 
a 
simulated 
swarm. 
In 
the 
future, 
we 
plan 
to 
develop 
novel 
interactive 
control 
interfaces 
to 
improve 
its 
interactivity. 


Lastly, 
since 
our 
current 
method 
uses 
uniform 
grids, 
it 
can 
only 
work 
in 
a 
relatively 
small 
domain. 
It 
cannot 
simulate 
swarms 
in 
an 
unlimited 
wide 
space. 
To 
overcome 
this 
limitation, 
one 
potential 
solution 
would 
be 
to 
apply 
nonuniform 
grids 
to 
solve 
both 
the 
potential 
field 
and 
the 
noise 
field 
(i.e., 
using 
sparse 
grids 
for 
the 
areas 
that 
contain 
a 
small 
number 
of 
insects. 
We 
plan 
to 
explore 
this 
as 
one 
of 
our 
future 
works. 


Our 
current 
approach 
can 
generate 
various 
types 
of 
noise-
aware 
insect 
motions 
using 
different 
parameters. 
However, 
gain 
and 
scale 
values 
are 
chosen 
empirically. 
Considering 
different 
insects 
typically 
have 
distinct 
swarm 
behaviors, 
these 
parameter 
value 
should 
be 
insect-specific. 
Also, 
since 
various 
insect 
species 
may 
react 
to 
boundaries 
in 
different 
ways, 
Equations 
3 
and 
6 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
insect-specific 
as 
well. 
This 
inspires 
us 
to 
look 
into 
an 
interesting 
inverse 
problem 
in 
the 
future: 
If 
we 
are 
able 
to 
acquire 
insect 
trajectories 
of 
various 
insects 
in 
a 
controlled 
environment, 
inversely 
solving 
the 
noise 
parameters 
from 
the 
acquired 
insect 
data 
would 
provide 
unprecedented 
knowledge 
and 
insights 
to 
many 
scientific 
fields 
that 
study 
biological 
motion 
of 
insects.
