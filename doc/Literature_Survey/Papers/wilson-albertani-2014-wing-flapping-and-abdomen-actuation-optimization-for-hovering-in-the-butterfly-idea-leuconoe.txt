This 
paper 
aims 
to 
further 
investigate 
the 
dynamics 
of

the

plays 
in 
the 
stability 
of 
its 
flight 
during 
hovering. 


II. 
Model 
& 
Methodologies 
This 
section 
details 
the 
computational 
model 
used 
to 
simulate 
the 
butterfly. 
The 
model 
uses 
motion 
parameter 
inputs 
to 
calculate 
the 
positions 
and 
orientations 
of 
the 
body 
parts, 
and 
their 
derivatives, 
at 
each 
timestep. 
Using 
the 
positions, 
velocities, 
and 
accelerations 
of 
the 
body 
parts, 
the 
instantaneous 
forces 
and 
moments 
acting 
on 
them 
can 
be 
calculated, 
which 
can 
be 
used 
to 
find 
the 
instantaneous 
acceleration 
and 
rotational 
acceleration. 
A 
differential 
equation 
is 
set 
that 
can 
be 
solved 
to 
calculate 
the 
position 
and 
orientation 
of 
the 
body 
with 
respect 
to 
time.

Numerical 
Model 
1. 
Input 
parameters 
The 
morphological 
parameters 
used 
as 
inputs 
to 
the 
model, 
namely 
the 
masses 
and 
dimensions 
of 
the 
butterfly’s 
individual 
body 
parts, 
were 
acquired 
from 
data 
taken 
at 
the 
McGuire 
Center 
for 
Lepidoptera 
and 
Biodiversity 
in 
Gainesville, 
FL. 
Mass 
measurements 
were 
taken 
from 
dead 
butterflies 
that 
had 
recently 
died 
from 
natural 
causes. 
Dimension 
measurements 
were 
estimated 
from 
the 
digitized 
butterfly, 
obtained 
from 
live 
measurements, 
illustrated 
in 
Figure 
2. 
Table 
1 
below 
lists 
the 
masses 
and 
dimensions 
used 
by 
the 
model.

Points 
were 
acquired 
along 
the 
edges 
of 
the 
digitized 
wings 
to 
build 
a 
matrix 
of 
coordinates 
that 
was 
used 
to 
reconstruct 
the 
wings’ 
geometry. 
An 
equivalent 
wing 
was 
created 
that 
merged 
the 
forewing 
and 
hindwing 
into 
a 
single 
wing 
with 
the 
same 
chord 
distribution 
as 
the 
two 
separate 
wings. 
Though 
research 
has 
shown 
that 
forewing-hindwing 
interactions 
have 
an 
effect 
on 
aerodynamic 
forces,5 
the 
difference 
is 
small(less 
than 
5%) 
in 
hovering 
when 
the 
wings 
flap 
in 
phase. 
Butterflies 
also 
slightly 
overlap 
their 
wings 
when 
flying, 
which 
justifies 
combining 
them 
to 
act 
as 
a 
single 
wing. 
Density 
was 
assumed 
constant 
throughout 
the 
body 
parts, 
and 
the 
butterfly 
was 
considered 
bilaterally 
symmetric.

Coordinate 
System 
and 
orientation 
of 
body 
parts 
Two 
right-handed 
coordinate 
systems 
were 
used 
in 
the 
model 
-a 
moving 
body 
coordinate 
system 
and 
a 
fixed 
global 
coordinate 
system, 
both 
shown 
in 
Figure 
3(d), 
with 
+Y 
being 
to 
the 
left 
in 
both 
coordinate 
systems, 
as 
seen 
in 
Figure 
3(a) 
and 
(b). 
Each 
angle 
had 
its 
amplitude, 
mean, 
and 
phase 
individually 
specified, 
with 
a 
single 
frequency 
parameter 
used 
for 
all 
angles, 
totalling 
13 
motion 
parameters. 
The 
three 
angles 
defining 
the 
position 
of 
the 
wings 
were 
the 
flapping 
angle, 
sweeping 
angle, 
and 
feathering 
angle, 
illustrated 
in 
Figure 
3, 
along 
with 
the 
abdomen 
angle, 
defined 
as 
the 
abdomen 
orientation 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
thorax 
in 
the 
symmetry 
plane.

.Note 
that 
for 
the 
wing 
angle 
figures 
(a) 
and 
(b), 
the 
coordinate 
system 
origin 
was 
shown 
at 
the 
wing 
root 
as 
the 
angles 
are 
defined 
from 
that 
point, 
though 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
body 
coordinate 
system 
is 
located 
at 
the 
abdomen 
root. 
The 
XY 
Z 
coordinate 
system 
is 
the 
body 
coordinate 
system, 
whereas 
the 
XgYgZg 
coordinate 
system 
in 
(d) 
is 
the 
fixed 
global 
coordinate 
system 


The 
value 
of 
any 
of 
the 
four 
angles 
at 
a 
given 
time 
t 
can 
be 
calculated 
using 
the 
following 
equation: 


θt 
= 
θA 
sin 
(2πf 
+ 
θp)+ 
θm 
(1) 


Where 
θA 
is 
the 
amplitude 
of 
the 
angle, 
θp 
is 
the 
phase 
angle, 
θm 
is 
the 
mean 
angle, 
and 
f 
is 
the 
frequency. 
The 
above 
equation 
can 
be 
used 
to 
calculate 
the 
angles 
as 
any 
time 
t, 
and 
subsequently 
the 
position 
and 
orientation 
of 
the 
wings 
and 
abdomen 
in 
the 
body 
frame 
at 
each 
timestep. 
The 
wing, 
which 
starts 
in 
the 
horizontal 
plane 
with 
the 
leading 
edge 
facing 
forwards, 
is 
rotated 
by 
the 
sweeping 
angle 
about 
the 
z-axis, 
then 
by 
the 
flapping 
angle 
about 
the 
x-axis, 
and 
finally 
the 
wing 
is 
then 
rotated 
about 
the 
wing 
axis 
by 
the 
feathering 
angle. 
The 
same 
process 
is 
applied 
using 
the 
angular 
velocity 
and 
acceleration 
derivatives 
of 
the 
angles, 
to 
determine 
the 
velocity 
and 
acceleration 
of 
the 
wings 
and 
abdomen, 
which 
are 
used 
in 
the 
calculation 
of 
the 
aerodynamic 
and 
inertial 
forces.

Aerodynamic

Aerodynamic 
forces 
were 
calculated 
using 
a 
quasi-steady 
state 
blade-element 
model, 
using 
20 
elements 
per 
wing. 
The 
model, 
using 
experimentally 
derived 
coefficients, 
accounts 
for 
forces 
due 
to 
wing 
translation, 
wing 
rotation, 
and 
inertia 
effects, 
including 
the 
added 
mass. 
The

and 
cˆ 
is 
the

The

calculated 
using 
the

The

accelerations, 
which

with

equations

form

set

the 
position 
vector 
and 
θ 
is 
the 
body 
orientation, 
both 
in 
the 
global 
coordinate 
system. 
Using 
an 
ODE 
solver, 
the 
time 
history 
of 
the 
body 
position 
and 
orientation, 
and 
their 
derivatives, 
can 
be 
solved 
for 
a 
specified 
flight 
time. 


B. 
Parameter 
Optimization 
Scheme 
To 
achieve 
hovering 
flight 
with 
acceptable 
pitch 
stability, 
the 
model 
was 
coupled 
to 
a 
genetic 
algorithm 
code 
to 
optimize 
the 
flight 
input 
parameters. 
The 
genetic 
algorithm 
used 
40 
individuals 
per 
generation. 
The 
reproduction 
parameters 
used 
were 
a 
5% 
mutation 
probability, 
a 
90% 
crossover 
probability, 
and 
a 
10% 
elitism. 
Each 
optimization 
was 
allowed 
to 
run 
for 
70 
generations. 


Stable 
hovering 
flight 
implies 
that 
a 
fixed 
position 
and 
orientation 
is 
maintained 
throughout 
the 
flight. 
Therefore, 
it 
was 
the 
goal 
of 
the 
genetic 
algorithm 
to 
minimize 
both 
the 
total 
displacement 
and 
the 
change 
in 
pitch 
orientation. 
A 
weighted 
sum 
objective 
function 
was 
used 
to 
combine 
these 
two 
objectives 
into 
one 
objective 
value 
that 
could 
be 
used 
to 
evaluate 
the 
fitness 
of 
each 
individual 
flight. 
The 
following 
objective 
function 
was 
used: 


fobj 
= 
W 
Δθ 
+(1 
− 
W 
)Δχ 
(17) 


Where 
fobj 
is 
the 
objective 
function 
value, 
W 
is 
the 
weighing 
factor, 
Δθ 
is 
the 
pitch 
deviation, 
and 
Δχ 
is 
the 
position 
deviation. 
The 
pitch 
and 
position 
deviation 
were 
defined 
as 
follows:

the

and

at 
time 
t, 
θobj 
and 
χobj 
are 
the 
desired 
pitch 
orientation 
and 
displacement, 
and 
θnorm 
and 
χnorm 
are 
the 
scaling 
factors 
used 
to 
normalize 
the 
two 
objectives. 
Table

), 
with

species 
of 
subtropical 
and 
tropical 
plants 
and 
trees 
and 
supports 
up 
to 
120 
different 
species 
and 
2,000 
free-flying 
butterflies. 


A 
vision-based 
estimation 
method 
was 
used 
to 
study 
the 
insects 
flight 
with 
negligible 
interference 
on 
their 
natural 
behavior. 
The 
visual 
system 
was 
composed 
of 
two 
high-speed 
digital 
cameras 
synchronized 
as 
a 
stereo 
pair. 
A 
stereo 
pair 
of 
cameras 
with 
known 
parameters 
and 
relative 
pose 
allows 
estimation 
of 
3D 
positions 
of 
points 
in 
space. 
The 
measurements 
were 
performed 
under 
natural 
sunlight 
conditions 
at 
100-200 
frames 
per 
second 
and 
a 
resolution 
of 
800x600 
pixels. 
A 
sequence 
of 
pictures 
of 
the 
desired 
events 
were 
captured 
from 
both 
cameras 
and 
converted 
to 
two 
videos, 
one 
for 
each 
camera. 
The 
videos 
were 
digitized 
using 
a 
free 
open 
source 
stereoscopy 
tracking 
software14 
and 
camera 
calibration 
data 
to 
perform 
3D 
stereovision 
estimation 
of 
selected 
points 
on 
the 
target. 


2. 
Data 
Postprocessing 
Voids 
were 
left 
in 
the 
position 
series 
data 
for 
the 
tracked 
points 
due 
to 
body 
parts 
views 
obstructed 
by 
other 
body 
parts 
or 
by 
the 
environment. 
To 
fill 
these 
voids, 
a 
statistical 
software 
was 
used, 
applying 
a 
smoothing 
spline 
to 
the 
(x,y,z) 
data 
for 
each 
point 
over 
a 
flight. 
The 
lambda 
value 
for 
each 
spline 
was 
adjusted 
until 
a 
smooth 
curve 
was 
produced 
that 
followed 
the 
general 
path 
of 
the 
available 
points 
and 
bridged 
the 
voids 
in 
the 
data. 


The 
tracked 
body 
part 
points 
were 
transformed 
into 
a 
fixed 
global 
coordinate 
system 
using 
tracked 
points 
on 
a 
reference 
target 
with 
a 
known 
position 
and 
orientation. 
After 
the 
points 
had 
been 
transformed 
into 
the 
global 
coordinate 
system, 
the 
pitch 
and 
yaw 
of 
the 
butterfly 
body 
vector(a 
vector 
from 
the 
abdomen 
root 
to 
the 
head) 
were 
calculated. 
These 
angles 
were 
used 
to 
define 
a 
butterfly 
body 
reference 
frame, 
a 
moving 
coordinate 
system 
with 
the 
origin 
at 
the 
abdomen 
root, 
the 
body 
vector 
pointing 
in 
the 
+X 
direction, 
the 
X-Z 
plane 
being 
the 
symmetry 
plane 
of 
the 
butterfly, 
with 
+Y 
facing 
left 
and 
+Z 
pointing 
up(with 
respect 
to 
the 
butterfly). 
The 
tracked 
points 
were 
transformed 
into 
the 
butterfly 
body 
frame 
so 
that 
the 
movement 
of 
the 
wingtips 
and 
abdomen 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
body 
could 
be 
analyzed.

For 
the 
random 
parameter 
solution, 
the 
butterfly 
begins 
descending 
rapidly 
and 
moves 
backwards. 
By 
t 
=0.5s, 
it 
reaches 
steady 
state, 
where 
it 
moves 
backwards 
with 
a 
mean 
velocity 
of 
-31.3cm/s 
in 
the 
X-
direction, 
with 
body 
position 
oscillations 
of 
amplitude 
0.38cm. 
It 
descends 
with 
an 
average 
velocity 
of 
-76.9cm/s 
in 
the 
Z-direction, 
with 
oscillations 
of 
0.56cm. 


The 
fixed-abdomen 
solution 
reaches 
steady 
state 
shortly 
after 
t 
=0.5s. 
The 
mean 
velocity 
in 
the 
X-
direction 
is 
relatively 
small 
at 
7.3cm/s, 
but 
has 
large 
body 
oscillations 
of 
9.22cm. 
Though 
it 
initially 
ascends 
during 
the 
transient 
stage, 
at 
steady 
state 
the 
butterfly 
descends 
with 
an 
average 
velocity 
of 
-12.8cm/s 
in 
the 
Z-direction 
with 
4.72cm 
oscillations. 


The 
active-abdomen 
solution 
performs 
significantly 
better 
compared 
to 
the 
other 
solutions 
at 
steady 
state, 
achieving 
mean

of 
2.1cm/s 
and

in 
the 
X-and

and

Figure

The 
random

reaches 
a 
steady 
state 
with 
a 
mean 
pitch 
of 
124.3◦ 
with 
oscillations 
of 
78.0◦ 
. 
For 
the 
fixed-abdomen 
solution, 
the 
steady 
state 
pitch 
has 
a 
mean 
of 
50.0◦ 
and 
oscillates 
at 
a 
180.9◦ 
amplitude. 
The 
active-abdomen 
solution, 
at 
steady 
state, 
has 
a 
mean 
pitch 
of 
36.4◦ 
that 
oscillates

Observing 
the 
steady

the 
active-abdomen 
solution 
clearly 
outperforms 
the 
others. 
In 
the 
X-

its

is 
over 
3x

In

Z-direction, 
its 
average

with

almost 
3x

The 
active-abdomen 
solution 
performs 
even 
better 
with 
regards 
to 
the 
pitch 
history. 
The 
pitch 
oscillations 
of

are 
10x 
smaller 
than 
the 
180.9◦ 
amplitude 
of 
the 
fixed

Though 
the 
random 
solution 
has 
smaller 
oscillations 
than 
the 
optimized 
solutions 
for 
the 
X-and 
Z-
direction 
velocities, 
and 
smaller 
pitch 
oscillations 
than 
the 
fixed-abdomen

its 
significant 
mean 
velocities 
preclude 
hovering 
flight. 
With 
a 
mean 
pitch 
of 
124.3◦

Force

arising

5 
flaps 
of 
the 
flight 
for 
(a) 
fixed-abdomen 
solution, 
and 
(b) 
active-abdomen 
solution. 


To 
determine 
how 
the 
abdomen 
potentially 
enables 
the 
butterfly’s 
increased 
stability 
in 
flight, 
the 
forces 
and 
moments 
from 
the 
wings 
and 
abdomen 
were 
examined 
for 
fixed-abdomen 
and 
active-abdomen 
flights, 
shown 
in 
Figure 
6. 


For 
the 
fixed-abdomen 
solution, 
the 
abdomen 
forces 
are 
small 
compared 
to 
the 
wing 
forces. 
There 
are 
no 
inertial 
forces 
as 
the 
abdomen 
is 
not 
accelerating 
relative 
to 
the 
body, 
and 
the 
abdomen 
drag 
is 
negligible 
compared 
to 
the 
wing 
aerodynamic 
forces. 
The 
moments 
arising 
from 
the 
abdomen 
forces 
are 
also 
relatively 
small 
-the 
only 
significant 
moment 
is 
due 
to 
the 
abdomen’s 
gravity, 
which 
is 
still 
5-10x 
smaller 
than 
the 
wing 
moments. 


For 
the 
active-abdomen 
solution, 
significant 
forces 
arise 
in 
both 
the 
X-and 
Z-directions 
due 
to 
the 
abdomen 
inertia. 
These 
forces 
are 
on 
the 
same 
scale 
as 
the 
wing 
forces, 
however 
the 
abdomen 
inertia 
forces 
oscillate 
about 
zero, 
and 
therefore 
likely 
contribute 
little 
to 
the 
propulsion 
of 
the 
butterfly. 
These 
forces 
generate 
large 
moments 
that 
are 
on 
the 
same 
scale 
as 
the 
wing 
moments. 
It 
can 
also 
be 
observed 
that 
the 
two 
are 
in 
antiphase 
with 
each 
other, 
where 
the 
wing 
moments 
are 
at 
a 
maximum 
when 
the 
abdomen 
moments 
are 
at 
a 
minimum, 
greatly 
reducing 
the 
total 
moment 
on 
the 
butterfly, 
contributing 
to 
its 
stability. 
Such 
moments 
could 
also 
imply 
that 
the 
wings 
are 
given 
more 
freedom 
in 
their 
motion, 
and 
can 
focus 
on 
generating 
forces 
to 
propel 
the 
butterfly 
without 
being 
as 
tightly 
constrained 
by 
the 
moments 
they 
create.

C. Experimental flight data 
A sample flight was selected for presentation that featured a long hovering sequence of a Tree Nymph. Figure 
7 shows, for the sample flight, the wingtip motions in the X- and Z-directions of the body frame, as well 
as the abdomen tip motion in the Z-direction. The X- and Z-direction motion of the wingtips correlates to 
the sweeping and flapping angles of the wings, respectively, while the Z-direction motion of the abdomen 
correlates to its angle relative to the butterfly body. Examining the motion of these body parts with respect 
to each other gives insight into how they interact, and potentially how the butterfly stabilizes itself during 
hovering.

motion in the Z-direction for both plots. 
In Figure 7(a), the wing sweeping and abdomen motion are in phase, with the wings moving forward 
as the abdomen moves down and vice versa. The sweeping of both wings is in phase for the majority of 
the flight, but two large out-of-phase strokes are seen near t = 1s and t = 1.25s. The butterfly performs a 
yawing maneuver at this point of the flight, and may use out-of-phase sweeping strokes to execute the turns. 
The abdomen motion is consistent throughout the entire flight, even during the out-of-phase sweeping, and 
oscillates slightly above the body, with the tip staying above the X-axis of the body frame for most of the 
flight. 
Figure 7(b) shows the flapping motion of the wings and the abdomen motion. The two are in anti-phase, 
with the abdomen moving upwards when the wings move downwards. The consistent oscillations of the 
abdomen in anti-phase with the wings could suggest the abdomen could possibly be used to dynamically 
balance the wing-flapping to stabilize the butterfly.

Figure 8 displays the wing-flapping motion in the body frame with the abdomen root Z-direction position 
in the global frame. The abdomen root position oscillates slightly out-of-phase with the wings. As would be 
expected, the butterfly gains altitude during the downstroke of the wings, when the most downward force is 
generated, and falls during the upstroke.

plays 
a 
significant 
role 
in 
the 
stabilization 
of 
the 
butterfly 
in 
hovering. 
At 
steady 
state, 
the 
optimized 
active-abdomen 
parameter 
set 
outperformed 
its 
fixed-abdomen 
counterpart. 
A 
smaller 
average 
velocity 
in 
both 
forward 
and 
vertical 
directions 
was 
observed 
for 
the 
active-abdomen 
solution, 
and 
the 
amplitude 
of 
its 
position 
oscillations 
were 
also 
significantly 
less. 
The 
active-abdomen 
solution 
was 
also 
significantly 
more 
stable 
in 
pitch, 
with 
oscillations 
of 
roughly 
20◦ 
, 
compared 
to 
the 
180◦ 
oscillations 
of 
the 
fixed-abdomen 
solution. 
Reduced 
oscillations 
in 
velocity 
and 
pitch 
could 
provide 
relevant 
advantages 
for 
vision-based 
flight 
control, 
typical 
of 
insects. 


The 
forces 
and 
moments 
during 
the 
two 
optimized 
flights 
gave 
insight 
into 
the 
abdomen 
motion 
function 
in 
stabilizing 
the 
butterfly. 
As 
the 
abdomen 
moments 
were 
capable 
of 
countering 
the 
wing 
moments 
to 
reduce 
the 
total 
pitching 
moment, 
pitching 
stability 
was 
greatly 
increased. 
The 
ability 
of 
the 
abdomen 
to 
generate 
large 
pitching 
moments 
could 
also 
potentially 
give 
the 
butterflies 
considerable 
freedom, 
allowing 
them 
to 
focus 
on 
wing 
motion 
that 
generates 
desired 
forces 
for 
propulsion, 
without 
having 
to 
fully 
account 
for 
the 
inertial 
moments 
generated. 
Though 
the 
abdomen 
actuation 
generated 
significant 
forces, 
these 
forces 
oscillated 
about 
a 
mean 
of 
roughly 
zero, 
and 
therefore 
did 
not 
appear 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
propulsion 
of 
the 
butterfly. 


Examination 
of 
experimental 
data 
from 
a 
recorded 
butterfly 
flight 
showed 
large 
abdomen 
movements 
that 
were 
in 
anti-phase 
with 
the 
wing-flapping 
motion, 
confirming 
that 
the 
abdomen 
may 
be 
used 
to 
dynamically 
balance 
the 
wing-flapping 
to 
provide 
stability 
during 
hovering. 
When 
examining 
the 
abdomen 
root 
position 
in 
the 
Z-direction 
with 
the 
wing-flapping 
motion, 
it 
appears 
that 
the 
butterfly 
gains 
altitude 
during 
the 
downstroke 
of 
the 
wings 
and 
subsequently 
loses 
altitude 
during 
the 
upstroke, 
as 
would 
be 
expected. 
This 
oscillating 
force 
allows 
the 
butterfly 
to 
maintain 
close 
to 
a 
fixed 
position 
in 
hovering.
