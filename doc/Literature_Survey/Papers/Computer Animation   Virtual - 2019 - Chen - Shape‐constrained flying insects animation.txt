INTRODUCTION 


Abstract 


During 
the 
past 
decades, 
high-fidelity 
realistic 
simulations 
of 
various 
flying 
insects 
exhibiting 
collective 
behavior 
have 
been 
broadly 
used 
in 
entertainment 
industries 
and 
virtual 
reality 
applications. 
However, 
due 
to 
the 
intrinsic 
complexity 
and 
high 
computational 
cost, 
shape 
constrained 
simulation 
of 
collective 
behaviors 
remains 
a 
challenging 
topic. 
In 
this 
paper, 
we 
present 
a 
robust 
multi-agent 
model 
for 
large-scale 
controllable 
shape 
constrained 
simulation 
of 
flying 
insects. 
Specifically, 
we 
design 
an 
internal 
force 
model 
to 
biologically 
mimic 
an 
individual 
insect. 
We 
also 
propose 
an 
external 
force 
model 
based 
on 
a 
trade-off 
mechanic 
to 
guide 
the 
insects 
smoothly 
deforming 
into 
a 
target 
shape. 
Our 
experimental 
results 
and 
comparative 
studies 
show 
our 
method 
is 
able 
to 
simulate 
realistic 
and 
dynamic 
flying 
insects 
with 
various 
user-specified 
shape 
constraints.

The 
large 
amount 
of 
insects 
are 
important 
living 
creatures 
on 
our 
earth 
and 
many 
of 
them 
exhibit 
collective 
behaviors 
on 
a 
regular 
basis. 
Normally, 
these 
insects 
fly 
in 
a 
rapid, 
chaotic 
manner 
and 
behave 
similarly 
as 
a 
large 
group. 
Not 
surprisingly, 
flying 
insects 
presenting 
special 
clustered 
shapes 
and 
deforming 
in 
time 
has 
been 
increasingly 
used 
as 
a 
special 
effect 
for 
entertainment, 
simulation, 
and 
virtual 
reality 
applications. 


Obviously, 
motion 
capture 
of 
a 
large 
set 
of 
insects 
in 
the 
real 
world 
is 
a 
daunting 
task, 
if 
not 
technically 
infeasible. 
Despite 
that, 
researches 
have 
attempted 
noticeable 
efforts 
to 
simulate 
certain 
collective 
behaviors 
of 
flying 
insects, 
including 
aggregation,1,2 
migration,3 
predation 
avoidance,4 
etc. 
However, 
to 
the 
best 
of 
our 
knowledge, 
to 
date 
relatively 
few 
efforts 
have 
been 
done 
to 
simulate 
constrained 
flying 
insects 
in 
the 
Computer 
Graphics 
community, 
e.g., 
imposing 
3D 
shape 
constraints. 
To 
achieve 
this, 
the 
central 
task 
would 
be 
to 
design 
a 
robust 
multi-agent 
model, 
in 
which 
each 
agent 
is 
driven 
by 
various 
intrinsic 
forces 
while 
satisfying 
user-specified 
constraints. 
Due 
to 
the 
control 
complexity 
and

cost, 
simulating 
biologically-plausible, 
shape 
constrained, 
collective 
behaviors 
of 
flying 
insects 
remains 
a 
widely-open 
research 
problem 
to 
date. 


In 
this 
paper, 
we 
propose 
a 
new 
force-based 
method 
to 
simulate 
visually-plausible, 
shape-constrained 
flying 
insects. 
Specifically, 
we 
extend 
a 
field-based 
method5 
to 
simulate 
the 
biologically-plausible 
collective 
behavior 
of 
each 
insect, 
and 
meanwhile 
the 
insects 
can 
rapidly 
form 
into 
a 
pre-defined 
shape 
through 
introduced 
external 
forces. 


The 
main 
contributions 
of 
our 
work 
can 
be 
summarized 
as 
follows: 


• 
a 
new 
method 
to 
generate 
flock 
morphing 
with 
pre-defined 
shape 
constraints 
while 
maximally 
preserving 
the 
biological-plausible 
dynamics 
of 
flying 
insects; 
• 
a 
new 
way 
to 
generate 
user-defined 
flock 
shapes 
by 
applying 
distance 
forces 
to 
gather 
flying 
insects.

RELATED 
WORK 


Constrained 
animation 
techniques 
have 
been 
widely 
studied 
for 
the 
simulation 
of 
crowds, 
fluid 
and 
flock. 
In 
this 
section, 
we 
briefly 
summarize 
recent 
previous 
works 
on 
constrained 
animation 
techniques 
for 
crowd 
simulation, 
fluid 
simulation, 
and 
flock 
simulation. 


Constrained 
crowd 
simulation. 
Guidance 
shape 
based 
methods 
are 
one 
of 
the 
most 
common 
techniques 
for 
constrained 
crowd 
simulation.6,7 
For 
instance, 
in 
the 
work 
of, 
Gu 
at 
al.8 
first 
sample 
a 
given 
shape, 
and 
then 
compute 
the 
correspondences 
between 
the 
sample 
points 
and 
the 
agents, 
finally 
a 
user-defined 
crowd 
shape 
can 
be 
obtained 
after 
each 
agent 
have 
arrived 
at 
a 
specific 
moving 
target 
position. 
The 
guidance 
mesh 
concept 
has 
also 
been 
exploited 
for 
group 
manipulation. 
For 
example, 
researchers 
achieve 
various 
crowd 
deformations 
using 
controllable 
meshes.9,10 
Recent 
works 
allow 
the 
users 
to 
manipulate 
group 
motions 
using 
an 
editable 
mesh.11,12 


Despite 
the 
success 
of 
the 
above 
methods, 
they 
essentially 
work 
in 
2D 
and 
may 
not 
be 
directly 
applicable 
for 
flying 
insects 
in 
the 
3D 
space. 


Constrained 
fluid 
simulation. 
A 
significant 
amount 
of 
research 
efforts 
have 
been 
conducted 
on 
constrained 
fluid 
simulation 
using 
guidance 
shapes 
to 
obtain 
more 
believable 
effects.13–15 
As 
one 
of 
the 
notable 
works 
in 
this 
direction, 
Hong 
et 
al. 
presented 
a 
method 
to 
control 
smoke 
shapes 
based 
on 
geometric 
potential 
fields.16 
McNamara 
et 
al. 
introduced 
an 
adjoint 
method 
to 
control 
the 
free 
surface 
of 
fluid, 
which 
can 
generate 
special 
fluid 
shape 
motion 
such 
as 
a 
running 
man.17 
Shi 
et 
al. 
presented 
a 
feedback 
force 
based 
method 
to 
dynamically 
adjust 
the 
discrepancy 
between 
the 
fluid 
and 
the 
dynamic 
target, 
which 
can 
generate 
fluid 
animations 
with 
user-defined 
shapes 
(e.g., 
a 
shape 
of 
running 
horse).18 
In 
the 
work 
of, 
Fattal 
and 
Lischinski19 
proposed 
an 
attractive 
force 
based 
method 
to 
gather 
smoke 
around 
a 
given 
target 
shape. 


However, 
the 
above 
methods 
may 
share 
part 
of 
key 
ideas 
of 
our 
work, 
but 
can 
not 
be 
directly 
applicable 
for 
flying 
insect 
simulation, 
since 
flying 
agents 
have 
different 
dynamic 
behaviors, 
which 
requires 
adaptable 
functions 
to 
control 
the 
flock 
trajectory 
and 
shape. 


Constrained 
flock 
simulation. 
Reynolds20 
was 
the 
first 
to 
develop 
a 
particle 
system 
to 
animate 
flock 
behaviors. 
Despite 
many 
excellent 
researching 
of 
flock 
simulation 
have 
been 
presented 
from 
then 
on, 
to 
the 
best 
of 
our 
knowledge, 
rare 
researchers 
have 
focused 
on 
shape-constrained 
flock 
animation. 
Anderson 
et 
al. 
presented 
several 
special 
shape 
constraints 
for 
bird 
motions 
in.21 
Moreover, 
Klotsman 
and 
et 
al 
recommend 
a 
solution 
to 
generate 
bird 
animations 
with 
special 
shapes 
(e.g., 
a 
V 
shape).22 
As 
for 
flying 
insects, 
Xu 
et 
al. 
delivered 
a 
flock 
animation 
method 
that 
can 
ensure 
the 
animation 
to 
form 
specific 
flock 
shapes.23 
Wang 
et 
al.24 
designed 
a 
curl-noise 
based 
model 
to 
simulate 
the 
constrained 
flock 
morphing 
of 
the 
global 
flock 
trajectory. 


However, 
it 
is 
noteworthy 
that 
the 
insects 
in 
the 
above 
methods 
show 
minimal 
dynamic 
behaviors 
after 
they 
have 
arrived 
at 
the 
target 
positions, 
which 
substantially 
reduces 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
visual 
effects.

OUR 
APPROACH 
OVERVIEW 


The 
pipeline 
of 
our 
approach 
is 
depicted 
in 
Figure 
1, 
which 
contains 
the 
following 
main 
parts:

Internal 
force, 
F⃗internal, 
by 
combining 
the 
Interaction 
force 
and 
the 
Curl-noise

to 
simulate 
the 
chaotic 
behaviors 
of 
flying 
insects. 


Part 
II. 
Constrained 
shape 
generation. 
First, 
we 
apply 
a 
stratified 
triangle 
sampling 
method 
to 
obtain 
sample 
points 
over 
the 
guidance 
target 
mesh. 
Then, 
we 
present 
a 
shape 
constrained 
force 
to 
optimally 
distribute 
the 
insects 
on 
the 
target 
mesh. 
Lastly, 
we 
design 
a 
distance 
force 
to 
attract 
the 
insects 
flying 
towards 
the 
sample 
points. 
By 
combining 
the 
shape 
constrained 
force 
and 
the 
distance 
force 
as 
an 
external 
force, 
F⃗external, 
we 
can 
preserve 
the 
shapes 
of 
special 
flock.

FIGURE 1 Overview of our shape-constrained flying insects model. The Swarm simulation is the weighted combination of the Interaction 
force (including three forces within three zones, i.e., repulsion, alignment and attraction) and the Curl-noise force; The Constrained shape 
generation is driven by both the Shape constrained force and Distance force. Then we iteratively update the positions of insects at each time 
step to obtain user-specified flock shapes 
FIGURE 2 Simulation of one key-frame of a running horse (10k agents) with different 𝛼 = 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 values 
Part III. Constrained animation. According to Newton's second law, we iteratively compute the acceleration of each 
insect based on both the internal and the external forces. Specifically, we update the insects' velocities at each time step 
with the consideration of obstacles when following the user-specified global migration path (see Section 6). 
In sum, any agent in our model is driven by a union force ⃗Fi and the proposed flying insect simulation model can be 
described by the following equation: 
⃗Fi = 𝛼 ⃗Fi, internal + (1 − 𝛼) ⃗Fi, external. (1) 
where 𝛼 is a controlling parameter used to balance the degree of the dynamics of the flying insects and the constraint 
of flock shape, through directly weighting the internal force ⃗Finternal and the external force ⃗Fexternal. Figure 2 shows the 
agents' different dynamics with different value of 𝛼 values. In our experiments, we empirically set 𝛼 = 0.7 to obtain better 
dynamics for agents within the shape constraint. 
4 SWARM SIMULATION 
In this section, we describe the internal force, through the combination of an interaction force and a curl-noise force, 
for swarm simulation, and it can simultaneously achieve the simulation of individual activities and flock behaviors. The 
internal force ⃗Fi, internal of the i-th agent includes the interaction force ⃗Fi, int (see Section 4.1) and the curl-noise force ⃗Fi, cur 
(see Section 4.2). 
4.1 Interaction Force 
As illustrated in the left of Figure 1, the basic idea of our interaction force model is to sort animals by three spheres(similar 
to1 ), denoted by three radii Rrep, Rali and Ratt (0 < Rrep < Rali < Ratt ). Specifically, Rrep denotes the repulsion zone which

However,in 
high-density 
circumstances, 
this 
could 
lead 
to 
violent 
oscillation 
phenomena, 
in 
which 
insects 
may 
repeatably 
be 
pushed 
away 
and 
dragged 
back 
by 
the 
repulsion 
force 
and 
the 
attraction 
force. 
We 
found 
that 
applied 
the 
Curl-noise 
field 
can 
avoid 
this 
issue. 
Curl-noise 
firstly 
proposed 
by 
Bridson 
et 
al.25 
for 
fluid 
simulation. 


Inspired 
by 
the 
above 
works, 
we 
extend 
the 
curl-noise 
as 
intrinsic 
force 
to 
drive 
the 
insects 
flow 
along 
the 
mesh 
surface, 
through 
which 
can 
avoid 
the 
oscillation 
phenomenon 
and 
generate 
more 
fluent 
visual 
effects. 
The 
curl-noise

can 
be 
computed

generation 
of 
user-specified 
flock 
shapes. 
First, 
we 
sample 
the 
inputted 
3D 
shapes 
based 
on 
a 
stratified 
points 
sampling 
method 
(Section 
5.1). 
Then, 
we 
design 
an 
external 
force 
to 
generate 
the 
specified 
flock 
shapes. 
The 
external 
force 
of 
the 
i-th 
agent, 
F⃗i, 
external, 
includes 
a 
shape-constrained 
force, 
F⃗i, 
con, 
to 
distribute

agents 
onto 
the 
mesh 
surface 
(Section 
5.2); 
and 
a 
distance 
force, 
F⃗i, 
dis, 
to 
attract 
insect 
flying 
toward 
the 
sampling 
point 
and 
flying 
around 
the 
target 
mesh 
faithfully 
(Section 
5.3). 


5.1 


3D 
Shape 
Sampling 


Without 
loss 
of 
generality, 
we 
assume 
the 
target 
shapes 
are 
3D 
triangulated 
meshes. 
Especially, 
we 
defined 
the 
sequence 
of 
key-frames 
with 
the 
same 
topology 
when 
it 
is 
captured 
from 
animation 
motions. 


Inspired 
by 
the 
work 
of,27 
we 
apply 
a 
stratified 
sampling 
method 
to 
obtain 
sample 
points 
from 
the 
guidance 
meshes. 
And, 
the 
stratified 
sampling 
method 
can 
better 
preserve 
geometric 
features 
between 
guidance 
sequences.28 


Considering 
insects' 
size 
information, 
we 
need 
ensure 
the 
minimum 
distance 
between 
any 
two 
insects 
during 
animation. 
So, 
we 
appropriately 
scale 
the 
inputted 
guidance 
meshes 
to 
meet 
the 
minimum 
distance 
requirement 
and 
generate 
adequate 
sample 
points. 
The 
sample 
points 
can 
be 
defined 
as 
si 
(i 
=1, 
2, 
3 
... 
N). 


5.2 


Shape 
Constrained 
Force 


In 
our 
method, 
we 
assume 
each 
sample 
point, 
si, 
on 
the 
guidance 
mesh 
has 
a 
spring-like 
force 
to 
attract 
and 
push 
away 
its 
neighboring 
points 
along 
the 
surface. 
We 
denote 
Ni 
as 
the 
number 
of 
neighbors, 
retained 
through 
a 
KD-Tree, 
of 
the 
i-th 
sample 
points 
that 
are 
within 
a 
Manhattan 
distance 
threshold 
from 
the 
point. 
In 
our 
experiments, 
we 
set 
this 
threshold

√ 


A

to 
kN 
,where 
A 
is 
the 
surface 
area 
of 
the 
mesh, 
and 
k 
is 
set 
to 
2.0. 


Inspired 
by 
the 
work 
of,29 
the 
shape 
constrained 
force 
in 
our 
work 
is 
defined 
as 
follows: 


(

Ni

where 
F⃗i, 
con 
is 
the 
shape 
constrained 
force 
for 
the 
i-th 
sample 
point; 
sj 
denotes 
the 
neighbor's 
position 
of 
the 
i-th 
sample 
point; 
Mij 
is 
the 
Manhattan 
distance, 
which 
requires 
less

without 
performance

to 
other

tance 
metrics 
such 
as 
the 
Euclidean 
distance. 
Besides, 
e 
is 
the 
energy 
between 
the 
i-th 
sample 
point 
and 
its 
j-th 


A

neighbor. 
𝜎 
=𝜔 
is 
only 
used 
to 
control 
the 
fall-off 
of 
the 
constrained 
force. 
𝜔 
is 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
neigh-

N 


bors. 
Increasing 
𝜔 
will 
decrease 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
neighbors 
to 
the 
i-th 
sample 
point. 
In 
our 
experiments, 
we 
empirically 
set 
𝜔 
to 
0.9. 


Typically, 
the 
distribution 
of 
the 
sample 
points 
can 
be 
solved 
at 
the 
preprocessing 
step. 
However, 
we 
observed 
that 
in 
the 
real-world 
flying 
insects 
tend 
to 
aggregate 
into 
a 
dense 
group, 
which 
may 
easily 
break 
the 
flock 
shape. 
Thus, 
we 
use 


⃗

Fi, 
con 
to 
scatter 
the 
insects 
along 
the 
mesh 
during 
the 
constrained 
animation. 


5.3 


Distance 
Force 


The 
objective 
of 
our 
method 
is 
to 
achieve 
certain 
flock 
shapes 
at 
specified 
frames 
while 
preserving 
intrinsic 
dynamic 
behaviors 
of 
the 
insects. 
To 
achieve 
this, 
after 
computing 
the 
guidance 
mesh, 
we 
compute 
the 
direct 
correspondences 
between 
the 
insects 
and 
the 
target 
positions 
(i.e., 
the 
sampled 
points). 
Then, 
we 
apply 
the 
distance 
force 
to 
attract 
the 
insects 
flying 
towards 
the 
target 
positions. 


Theoretically, 
the 
distance 
force 
will 
disappear 
when 
an 
insect 
arrives 
at 
its 
destination, 
or 
loses 
its 
influence 
when 
the 
insect 
flies 
around 
the 
target 
position 
within 
a 
short 
distance. 
At 
this 
point, 
the 
internal 
force 
will 
dominate 
the 
dynamic 
behaviors 
of 
the 
insect. 
Then, 
while 
the 
escaping 
distance 
is 
increased 
due 
to 
the 
internal 
force, 
the 
attractive 
force 
will 
also 
be 
recovered 
and 
continue 
attracting 
the 
insect. 
Based 
on 
this 
consideration, 
we 
design 
a 
harmonic 
attractive 
force 
as 
a 
function 
of 
the 
distance 
force 
F⃗i, 
dis 
(illustrated 
in 
Figure 
3), 
defined 
as 
follows: 


( 
)(−→)

F⃗i,dis 
=𝜔dis 
·H(d)· 
4 
∗(d 
−0.5)1∕3 
+0.5 
· 
rdisi 
, 
(6) 


where 
d 
denotes 
the 
Euclidean 
distance 
between 
the 
i-th 
agent's 
position 
⃗ri 
and 
its 
corresponding 
destination 
⃗si. 
𝜔dis 
is 
the 
weight 
to 
adjust 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
distance 
force. 
We 
can 
obtain 
more 
stable 
flock 
shapes 
by 
increasing 
the 
value

field. 
D 
denotes 
the 
Euclidean 
distance 
between 
the 
insect's

Fdist 
is 
the 
distance 
force, 
which 
gradually 
declines 
to 
0 
from 
the 
position 
of 
the 
insect 
to

bottom: 
𝜔dist 
=8). 
Increasing 
the 
value 
of 
𝜔dist 
can 
obtain 
more 
stable 
flock 
shapes 
and 
gradually 
limit 
the 
movements

but 
a

large

will

shown 
in 
the 
bottom

In

of 
our 
experiments,

is 
set 
to

i.e.,

the

PATH 
PLANNING 
AND 
COLLISION 
AVOIDANCE 


With 
the 
aforementioned 
internal 
force 
and 
external 
force, 
our 
approach 
can 
automatically 
simulate 
the 
constrained 
flock 
animation 
without 
user 
interventions, 
except 
providing 
3D 
meshes 
as 
guidance 
shapes 
at 
key-frames. 
In 
specific, 
to 
update 
the 
velocities 
of 
the 
insects 
in 
the 
process 
of 
the 
constrained 
flock 
simulation, 
we 
compute 
their 
accelerations 
based 
on 
Newton's 
second 
law 
and 
calculate 
the 
updated 
velocities 
with 
the 
time 
interval 
dt. 
Moreover, 
since 
different 
flying 
insects 
have 
different 
flight 
speed 
ranges 
in 
the 
real 
world,30 
we 
set 
the 
max 
speed 
as 
0.75 
m/s 
in 
our 
experiments, 
which 
is 
approximately 
the 
flight 
speed 
of 
flies. 
Note 
that 
the 
max 
speed 
can 
also 
be 
replaced 
as 
a 
viscous 
drag 
force 
in 
our 
scheme. 
Additionally, 
we 
design 
the 
path 
planning 
and 
collision 
avoidance 
parts 
of 
our 
approach 
as 
follows. 


Global 
path 
planning. 
In 
many 
applications, 
global 
migration 
paths 
of 
the 
flock 
will 
generate 
more 
artistic 
effects 
of 
the 
constrained 
animation. 
In 
our 
approach, 
we 
apply 
an 
arbitrary 
B-spline 
curve 
as 
the 
global 
path. 
Thus, 
through 
arc-length 
parameterization, 
we 
align 
the 
global 
positions 
of 
the 
flock 
with 
the 
curve. 


Collision 
avoidance. 
In 
our 
method, 
each 
insect 
keeps 
a 
private 
space 
within 
the 
distance 
Rrep, 
because 
intruders 
will 
be 
pushed 
away 
by 
the 
repulsive 
force 
Frep. 
However, 
the 
insects 
may 
tend 
to 
aggregate 
into 
a 
dense 
group 
under 
the 
attractive 
forces. 
This 
especially 
could 
happen 
to 
some 
animal 
guidance 
shapes 
with 
slim 
legs 
or 
horns,

n⃗

u⃗ 
is 
the 
actual

of 
the

while 
u⃗a 
is 
the 
avoidance 
velocity. 
The 
insect 
flies 
toward 
the 
obstacle 
with 
the 
velocity 
u⃗ 
(left), 
u⃗ 
smoothly 
ramps 
down 
towards 
the 
tangent 
(middle), 
and 
the 
actual 
velocity 
u⃗ 
is 
replaced 
by 
the 
avoidance 
velocity 
u⃗a 
(right) 


such 
as 
a 
deer 
shape. 
In 
such 
cases, 
we 
adapt 
the 
minimum 
distance 
enforcement 
(MDE) 
method31 
to 
separate 
the 
two 
insects 
with 
their 
distance 
lower 
than 
a 
user-specified 
threshold. 
Therefore, 
our 
method 
can 
ensure 
local 
collision 
avoidance. 


Furthermore, 
we 
apply 
the 
method 
proposed 
by 
Bridson 
et 
al.25 
to 
avoid 
obstacles 
for 
insects 
when 
moving 
along 
the 
global 
path. 
We 
assume 
the 
obstacles 
are 
stationary 
in 
the 
environment. 
To 
avoid 
an 
obstacle, 
the 
velocity 
vector 
of 
the 
insect, 
u⃗, 
needs 
to 
be 
tangent 
to 
the 
normal 
at 
the 
boundary 
of 
the 
obstacle, 
n⃗.Inother 
words, 
u⃗ 
· 
n⃗ 
= 
0. 
Thus, 
the 
insects 
should 
smoothly 
slow 
down 
when 
approaching 
the 
obstacle 
(as 
shown 
in 
Figure 
5). 
So, 
we 
replace 
the 
velocity 
u⃗ 
with 
the 
obstacle 
avoidance 
velocity 
u⃗a, 
defined 
below: 


u⃗a 
= 
ramp(·) 
· 
u⃗ 
+(1 
− 
ramp(·))n⃗(n⃗

where 
ramp(·) 
is

function 
with 
a

x 
= 
Ddist∕L; 
Ddist 
denotes 
the 
shortest 
distance 
from 
the 
insect 
to

and 
L 
is 
used 
to 
alter 
the 
influence 
range. 
Also, 
ramp(·)

RESULTS 
AND 
COMPARISON 


We 
implemented 
our 
method 
with 
C++ 
language 
and 
ran 
many 
simulations 
on 
an 
off-the-shelf 
PC 
with 
Intel(R) 
Core(TM) 
i7-7700 
CPU 
and 
16GB 
memory. 
We 
employed 
an 
efficient 
nearest 
neighbors 
search 
algorithm32 
to 
query 
the 
nearest 
neighbors 
of 
insects 
when 
computing 
the 
attractive 
force 
and 
shape-constrained 
force. 
We 
fixed 
the 
parameters 
for 
all 
the 
simulations 
and 
recorded 
the 
positions 
and 
directions 
of 
all 
the 
insects 
for 
rendering 
in 
Cinema 
4D. 
We 
reported 
the 
performances 
of 
our 
simulation 
experiments 
in 
Table 
1. 
As 
clearly 
shown 
in 
this 
table, 
our 
method 
is 
efficient 
and 
can 
achieve 
a 
real-time 
performance 
with 
10,000 
insects 
on 
an 
off-the-shelf 
computer. 
The 
animation 
results 
are 
enclosed 
in 
the 
supplemental 
demo 
video 
of 
this 
paper. 
The 
selected 
rendering 
scenarios 
are 
described 
below. 


Moon-shape 
flying 
insects: 
In 
Figure 
6, 
we 
show 
an 
animation 
where 
10,000 
flying 
insects 
are 
morphed 
into 
a 
moon 
shape 
with 
biologically-plausible 
motion 
in 
the 
night. 
At 
the 
start 
of 
the 
animation, 
the 
insects 
gradually 
fly 
towards 
the 
boundary 
of 
the 
pre-defined 
target 
and 
form 
a 
user-specified 
flock 
shape 
at 
the 
end. 
Each 
insect 
can 
fly 
chaotically 
and 
faithfully 
follow 
its 
target 
position 
during 
the 
animation, 
producing 
believable 
visual 
effects 
as 
a 
flock. 


From 
a 
mammoth 
shape 
to 
a 
shark 
shape: 
In 
this 
experiment, 
we 
show 
the 
flock 
morphing 
from 
a 
mammoth 
shape 
to 
a 
shark 
shape 
in 
Figure 
7. 
The 
results 
of 
our 
experiment 
indicate 
that 
the 
flock 
can 
fluently 
change 
their 
flock 
shape 
from 
an 
arbitrary 
shape 
to 
another. 
Also, 
our 
approach 
can 
obtain 
real-time 
performances 
when 
the 
total 
number 
of 
insects 
is 
no 
more 
than 
10,000 
(refer 
to 
Table 
1). 


A 
flock 
with 
a 
running 
horse 
shape: 
Figure 
8 
shows 
a 
flock 
morphing 
along 
with 
a 
rapidly-changing 
motion 
target. 
A 
running 
horse, 
formed 
with 
10,000 
insects, 
follows 
a 
user-specified 
global 
trajectory. 
When 
the 
insects 
confront 
an 
obstacle, 
the 
flock 
shape 
will 
be 
affected 
temporarily, 
e.g., 
the 
insects 
avoid 
the 
obstacle 
like 
fluid. 
Such 
a 
morphing 
feature 
can 
be 
practically 
useful 
for 
certain 
visual 
effects 
applications. 


Also, 
we 
simulated 
the 
simplified 
scenarios 
with 
different 
numbers 
of 
insects 
to 
compare 
their 
visual 
results 
and 
computational 
efficiencies 
(refer 
to 
Table 
1).

more 
animation 
results,

Comparison 
with 
the

method: 
We 
also 
compared 
our 
method 
with 
a 
baseline 
method.23 
The 
method 
in23 
can 
also 
obtain 
stable 
flock 
shapes, 
but 
the 
simulated 
insects 
are 
sticked 
at 
the 
boundary 
of 
the 
guidance 
mesh,

DISCUSSION 
AND 
CONCLUSION 


In 
this 
paper, 
we 
present 
a 
new 
force-based 
method 
to 
simulate 
shape-constrained 
flying 
insects 
animation. 
Essentially, 
weapplyinternalforcesto 
simulate 
thebiologically-plausiblecollective 
behaviorofeach 
insect, 
and 
theinsectscan 
rapidly 
form 
into 
a 
pre-defined 
shape 
by 
applying 
external 
forces. 
Through 
various 
simulation 
experiments, 
we 
demonstrate 
that 
our 
method 
can 
guide 
large-scale 
flying 
insects 
so 
that 
they 
deform 
into 
arbitrary 
target 
shapes, 
and 
morph 
from 
one 
shape 
to 
another. 
Especially, 
our 
method 
can 
ensure 
flying 
insects 
to 
naturally 
follow 
the 
targets 
with 
rapid 
motion, 
while 
maximally 
preserving 
the 
dynamics 
of 
the 
insects. 
The 
computational 
cost 
of 
our 
method 
mainly 
depends 
on 
the 
number 
of 
the 
simulated 
insects. 
Our 
method 
is 
highly 
efficient; 
the 
performances 
of 
our 
experiments 
show 
that 
our 
method 
can 
be 
used 
for 
real-time 
simulations 
even 
for 
large-scale 
insects 
(e.g., 
more 
than 
10k 
insects). 


Our 
current 
method 
has 
two 
limitations: 
First, 
the 
morphing 
of 
flock 
shapes 
relies 
on 
user-provided 
guidance 
3D 
models. 
An 
more 
intuitive 
way 
for 
specifying 
the 
guidance 
meshes 
would 
be 
preferred, 
such 
as 
a 
sketching 
interface. 
Second, 
there 
are 
many 
parameters 
in 
our 
multi-agent 
and 
force-based 
model. 
At 
present, 
we 
fix 
the 
appropriate 
setting 
values 
based 
on 
heuristic 
optimization 
methods. 
In 
the 
future, 
we 
tend 
to 
develop 
a 
benchmark 
to 
evaluate 
the 
visual 
quality 
of 
simulated 
insect 
animations, 
which 
will 
enable 
to 
explore 
an 
automatic 
parameters 
optimization 
method.
