WING SHAPE AND FLIGHT BEHAVIOUR IN BUTTERFLIES 
(LEPIDOPTERA: PAPILIONOIDEA AND HESPERIOIDEA): 
A PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS

Summary 

Representatives of six butterfly species, flying freely in the field or in simulated 
field conditions, were filmed with a high-speed cin6 camera and subjected to 
kinematic and morphometric analysis. This is the first detailed investigation on an 
insect performing the varied patterns of 'natural' flight. Kinematic parameters in 
representative sequences of selected flight modes were calculated and compared, 
and wing shapes were characterized using aspect ratio and non-dimensional 
moment parameters. 

The analyses and field observations of these and other butterflies suggest 
possible correlations between flight performance and wing shape. The behaviour 
of individual species conforms reasonably well with crude predictions based on 
aspect ratio, wing loading and wing inertia. 

Introduction 

Although several investigations have been carried out on the relationships 
between form and function in insect wings (e.g. R. A. Norberg, 1975; Pfau, 1978; 
Wootton, 1981; Newman, 1982; Brodsky & Ivanov, 1983; Betts, 1986a,b,c; 
Newman & Wootton, 1986), the significance of wing shape (= planform) has been 
neglected. In contrast, in birds and bats active work on this aspect is in progress 

(U. M. Norberg, 1981; U. M. Norberg & Rayner, 1987; Rayner, 1987). We have 
carried out a preliminary investigation on a small sample of a selection of butterfly 
species. Butterflies were chosen because of their diversity of size, wing shape and 
flight pattern, and because their large size and low wing beat frequencies make 
them relatively easy to film with a portable high-speed cin6 camera in the field or in 
large enclosures, for later kinematic analysis. This was important: up to now 
almost all kinematic studies of insects have been restricted to tethered flight or to

free flight in small laboratory enclosures, which inevitably limits the range of flight 
patterns performed and inhibits normal behaviour. 

Wing design is often a compromise between several functions. The wings of 
butterflies may act in sexual and territorial display; in cryptic or warning defence; 
in thermoregulation (Kingsolver, 1985); and in a wide range of flight patterns 
reflecting their complex behaviour (e.g. Baker, 1972; Davies, 1978). Nachtigall 
(1976), Martin & Carpenter (1977), Bocharova-Messner & Aksyuk (1982), 
Ellington (1981, 1984a,b) and Brodsky & Ivanov (1984) have investigated the 
aerodynamics. 

Wing shape is difficult to quantify and in much of the literature is presented 
simply in the form of the aspect ratio, which has serious shortcomings in describing 
insect wings. The value of the moments of area was stressed by Weis-Fogh (1973), 
and their use has been greatly extended by Ellington (1984a, part II), whose 
discussion of wing shape is a breakthrough in morphometric investigation. The 
non-dimensional moments of area are functions of wing shape in that they depend 
solely on the distribution of the non-dimensional chord along the wing; those of 
mass are rather less precise functions of three-dimensional shape. The radius of 
the first moment of area gives the position of the centroid, that of the first moment 
of mass the position of the centre of mass. Moments of area and mass also have 
mechanical significance: the first moment of mass is proportional to the inertial 
force on the flapping wings, and the second moment is the moment of inertia of the 
wing pair. The second moment of area is proportional to the mean lift force in a 
quasi-steady-state aerodynamic analysis, and the third moment to the mean profile 
power (Weis-Fogh, 1973). 

Ellington (1984a, part II) has shown empirically for a range of flying animals mostly 
insects, but including two birds and a bat - that for both area and mass the 
radii of the second and third moments are very closely correlated with the first 
moment. He did not include broad-winged Lepidoptera, and a secondary aim of 
the present investigation has been to test whether Ellington's conclusion holds for 
butterflies. If the relationship proves to be true for insects in general, then it 
becomes possible to characterize the shape of a wing with reference to a single, 
easily found parameter - the first moment of area - and the mass distribution 
similarly by the first moment of mass. A single value for the first moment does not 
precisely define a single wing shape as it cannot accurately show asymmetry about 
the longitudinal axis, but it does appear to represent the wing with respect to the 
mechanical effects of area distribution, and seems clearly preferable to any single 
mode of shape measurement previously employed. 

Materials and methods 

Definitions of terms 

A wing couple consists of the forewing and hindwing on one side of the body. 

A wing pair consists either of both forewings or of both hindwings. 


Butterfly flight 

A flight mode is a category of movement at more-or-less constant velocity, e.g. 
fast forward flight, slow forward flight, fast climb, hovering. 

A flight manoeuvre is a change of velocity in flight, through alteration of speed, 
direction or both. One may distinguish simple manoeuvres, like turning or slowing 
down, and compound manoeuvres involving sequences of simple manoeuvres. 

A flight behaviour pattern is a recognizable sequence of flight modes and 
manoeuvres, whose ecological significance may well be apparent. 
Flight performance is the range of modes and manoeuvres of which an insect is 
capable. 

The phrase 'flight category' is used to include both modes and manoeuvres. 

Flight modes and simple manoeuvres are - in theory at least - easy to quantify, 
although there may be practical difficulties. Quantitative description of behaviour 
patterns is difficult, and has seldom been attempted, but it may prove possible by 
recording sequences of modes and manoeuvres. 

Species selected 
Four species of butterfly: Troides rhadamantus H. Lucas (TR), Papilio 
rumanzovia Eschscholtz (PR), Pachliopta hector Linnaeus (PH) and Graphium 
sarpedon Linnaeus (GS), showing a range of wing shapes and sizes, were obtained 
from a dealer for filming in this country. Eight more species were filmed and 
captured in and around the secondary rain forest at Ulu Gombak Field Station, 
Malaysia, and data from two of these, Precis iphita Cramer (PI) and Idmon sp. 
(ID), are included in the present study (Fig. 1). Further observations were made 
on butterflies in the wild in the UK and Malaysia. 

Maintenance of adults 

Four specimens each of four species of tropical butterfly were purchased as 
pupae from Entomological Livestock Supplies Ltd. Insects were placed in a netted 
enclosure ('Papronet': Direct Wire Ties Ltd) approximately 5mx2mx3m , in a 
section of glasshouse maintained between 20°C and 28°C and between 45 % and 
85 % relative humidity. 

Filming 

All cine"-films were taken using a tripod-mounted, battery-pack powered 
Photosonics high-speed cin6 camera with a 72 mm Angenieux zoom lens and reflex 
viewing system. 

In the field only natural light was used: in Malaysia exposures at around f4 were 
used for camera speeds between 250 and 300 frames per second (frames s"1), 
which required force-processing of 150ASA rated film by 2 stops. In the UK f2-8-3 
gave similar results. In the enclosure, natural light plus 6650 W of artificial light 
gave exposures at camera speeds of 250 frames s"1 and f3—4 which required force-
processing of 50ASA film by 2 stops for a grainy, but usable result. All filming in 
the enclosure used Ilford Pan-F (50 AS A) black and white 16 mm film. In the field

Analysis 
Morphological parameters 

The following parameters were measured or calculated (see Fig. 2). 

(1) Total mass, m (g). 
(2) Body length, L (mm). 
(3) Wing length (forewing length as shown in Fig. 2), R (mm). 
(4) Wing area (total area of both pairs of forewings and hindwings when 
linked), S (mm2). 
(5) Aspect ratio, AR; given by AR = 4R2S~1. 
(6) Wing loading, Pw (Nm~2); given by Pw = mS"1. 
(7) Moment of inertia of both wing couples, Iw (kgm2). 
(8) Non-dimensional radius of the first moment of wing area, f^S); given by 
f^S^fdf
f^S^cfdf. 

(9) Non-dimensional radius of the second moment of wing area, f2(S); given( 
byf2(S)=|'cf2df.

(10) Non-dimensional radius of the first moment of wing mass, ?i(m); given 
(11) Non-dimensional radius of the second moment of wing mass, ?2(m); 
given by f2(m) = I nVrdf. 
(12) Non-dimensional radius of the first moment of virtual mass fi(v); given 
(13) Non-dimensional radius of the second moment of virtual mass, f2(v); 
given by f2(v) = l/vj^r^df. 
Derivations of parameters 8-13 are given by Ellington (1984a). f is the distance 
from the wing base of an element of the wing with non-dimensional chord c and 
non-dimensional mass riY. v is the non-dimensional virtual mass of both wing 
couples. The virtual mass is the mass of air which is accelerated along with the 
wings during their motion. 

All masses for 1, 7,10 and 11 were taken from fresh specimens. Those collected 
in Malaysia could not be weighed fresh, and these parameters were therefore not 
available. Values for 7 and for the moment parameters 8-13 were found by strip 
analysis. For the moments of area, photographs of the fore- and hindwings, linked 
in the flight position, were divided into narrow strips concentric to the wing base 
(see Fig. 2, left-hand side). For 7 and for the moments of mass, the fore- and 
hindwing, linked as in flight, were cut into narrow, straight strips, parallel to the 
body axis (Fig. 2, right-hand side). The virtual masses of both wing couples, and 
the non-dimensional radii of their first and second moments were calculated for 
the sake of completeness, but are not discussed. 

Ellington (1984a, part II) notes that for animals with AR < 4, the circular chord, 
as used here for the area parameters, gives more accurate values than the 
rectangular chord. Unfortunately, it was only possible to obtain rectangular strip 
values for analysis of wing mass. These still provide a sound basis for comparative 
study. 

The positioning of the wings for strip analysis is important. Butterflies in

collections are conventionally displayed with their wings fully extended. Observations 
from films suggest that this attitude is rarely achieved and is only transitory 
(at stroke extremes for instance): the attitudes of the wings in the outlines in Figs 1 
and 2 are much more usual. Use of the circular chord eliminates the need to align 
the forewing other than extending it to its natural position. However, rectangular 
chord measurements and values for R would be affected by wing attitude: here 
measurements of R have all been made from wings aligned as in Fig. 2. 

Film analysis 

Timings of stroke intervals and tracings were all taken from images projected 
from an optical data analyser onto a flat surface using a front-silvered mirror. 

Films were digitized for computer analysis using a PCD digital data reader, 
model ZAE1E, incorporating a back projection screen and digitizer. Digitizer 
drift and frame distortion were negligible. The output was fed into an Apple II via 
a standard eight-bit analogue-digital converter. Programs developed by Newman 
(1982) were used to analyse the data. To summarize, the spatial relationships of 
the wing and body positions relative to the horizontal plane are calculated from the 
three-dimensional coordinates generated by computer for each digitized film 
frame. Changes in angular position of the wings and body can thus be accurately 
measured for the entire sequence and, by reference to a standard time-base, 
accelerations and relative velocities calculated. For further details of analysis 
procedures and notes on the form of the data produced by these programmes see 
Betts (1986c). 

Parameters measured during film analysis (with abbreviations and units) were as 
follows (see Fig. 3). 

(i) Wing beat frequency, n (Hz). 
(ii) Mean angular velocity during downstroke, co (rads"1). 
(iii) Flight velocity, V (ms"1) (presented in non-dimensional form in this

(iv) Advance ratio (ratio of the flight velocity to the mean flapping velocity of

Results 

Morphometrics and wing shape 

Table 1 summarizes morphometric data for the specimens filmed. Mean values 
have not been calculated because of the small sample sizes. Fig. 4 presents the 
relationship between the position of the centroid of wing area [^(S)] and its radius 
of gyration [f2(S)] using data from this study. Data from Ellington (1984a, part II) 
are also included and the curve plotted represents the geometric relationship 
established by Ellington (1981, equation 38). Fig. 5 presents the equivalent 
relationship for wing mass and includes data and the curve representing the 
geometric relationship from Ellington (1981, equation 43). Figs 4 and 5 compare 
the geometric and empirical relationships. 

Kinematics 

Table 2 summarizes all the kinematic data from the film sequences analysed by 
computer. The butterflies displayed a wide range of complex flight patterns, each 
being a sequence of modes and rapid manoeuvres. In the course of filming and 
analysis four flight modes were distinguished: (1) fast climb (*FC); (2) slow 
forward flight (*SF); (3) fast forward flight (*FF); (4) hovering (*H). In the 
discussion which follows, two manoeuvres (tight turns and glides) are also 
recognized, but not analysed. 

The flight modes were distinguished using ranges of values for J, the advance 
ratio, which proved to be the most consistent kinematic parameter (Table 2). 
Where J <0 1 the insect was considered to be hovering, as in Ellington (1984a, 
part III). The remaining limits have been decided by repeated visual analysis of 
film sequences. Fast forward flight and fast climb or take-off were separated by an 
additional variable, the ratio of horizontal to vertical movement, describing the 

(flight angle of the specimen. Sequences with values of this variable less than 2 
represented a steep climb or take-off. Take-off was easily recognized visually.

Discussion 

Wing shape 

The moment parameters usefully characterize wing shape. They can also give 
aerodynamic information (for which they were originally designed) and, in 
conjunction with other morphometric data, yield some interesting observations on 
overall wing design. Figs 4 and 5 show that data from the current study fit 
Ellington's (1984a, part II) geometrical laws very closely (no significant statistical 
difference). This is even true when the wings are badly worn (Graphium3, 
Papilio2, Pachliopta2) suggesting that, although substantial areas of the wing 
margin can be lost during normal flying life (25 % for Graphium 3), this wear can

be uniform, so that wing shape remains symmetrical. The large spread of values on 
both graphs is both inter- and intraspecific in origin. Wing damage may account for 
some of the variation; and males and females can also have different wing shapes 
(compare Troidesl, male, and Troides2, female, in Fig. 1). In the intact 
individuals examined, wing area is concentrated quite near the base, with the 
larger specimens having the lowest ft(S) values (0-4-0-45). Low values are 
characteristic of flying animals with broad wing bases, like most papilionid 
butterflies. The distribution of wing mass is much more variable, some specimens 
having it concentrated towards the wing base (Troides, Graphium), others where 
the centre of wing mass is more distal, comparable to dragonflies (intact Papilio 1 
and Pachliopta). 

Wing loading in the butterflies examined is also very low, at the bottom end of 
the range of flying animals (see data in Ellington, 1984a). 

Of those examined, intact specimens of Papilio and Troides have the most 
similar wing shape and size. Their flight behaviour, however, is very different, and 
^here are structural differences. Intact Papilio 1 has more wing area concentrated 


282 C. R. BEITS AND R. J. WOOTTON 

basally [^(S) = 0-343; average Troides values = 0-381] but relatively more mass 
concentrated distally [^(m) = 0-458; average Troides values = 0-331]. Papilio is 
much lighter than Troides, and the wing loading of both specimens is 20 % lower 
than in Troides. 

Kinematics 

It is possible to characterize each flight mode using the kinematic parameters 
described earlier (see values of J in Table 2). Although there are inconsistencies, 
due both to flight versatility and analysis error, some patterns are still discernible 
from the data, and from extensive qualitative observation, and unlisted measurements 
from other sequences. 

Fast forward flight 
The kinematics of Troides and Papilio were notably different through the range 
of flight behaviour. During fast forward flight Papilio had a lower mean angular 
velocity than Troides, but comparable wing beat frequency and greater stroke 
amplitude. Body angle was continually changing in all species recorded, with a 
good deal of vertical motion and pitching. Stroke plane angle is affected by 
altering the body angle; and the greater the stroke plane angle, the faster the flight 
speed (Ellington, 1984a: part III). In fast flight, Papilio adopted a higher range of 
body angles than Troides, and the stroke plane was consequently shallower. In 
contrast, Pachliopta adopted a steep stroke plane angle and greater wing beat 
frequency and mean angular velocity than Troides and Papilio. 
Precis had the highest non-dimensional flight velocity in this mode, employing a 
near-vertical stroke plane with a shallow body angle. Both stroke amplitude 
(visual estimate) and upstroke/downstroke ratio were by far the highest among 
the butterflies studied and may indicate the aerodynamic mechanism employed 
(see next section). 

Slow forward flight 
During slow forward flight both Papilio and Graphium had greater stroke 
amplitude, mean angular wing velocity and stroke plane angle, but lower wing 
beat frequency than in fast flight. Troides also increased its mean angular wing 
velocity, but in contrast reduced its stroke plane angle. This variation between 
species in change of stroke plane angle suggests different flight strategies. In all 
three species, the consistent increase in mean angular wing velocity was accompanied 
by an increase in the US:DS ratio; these latter changes appeared to 
continue as flight speed decreased, culminating in the extreme values seen during 
hovering. 
Pachliopta, most frequently seen in this flight mode, showed little consistent 
kinematic change between modes. 

Hovering 

During hovering, in most sequences analysed, a mean body angle of around 15° 


Butterfly flight 

was maintained, associated in all species except Troides with a steeply inclined 
stroke plane. Although a horizontal stroke plane was certainly used on occasions, 
particularly by Graphium, this was more the exception than the rule. Indeed an 
inclined stroke plane may well be more common in other hovering insects than 
previously supposed (A. R. Ennos, personal communication). Stroke amplitude 
varied but mean angular velocity was greater for Papilio and Graphium than in 
their other flight modes. There was a relative increase in upstroke times during 
hovering except in Pachliopta, which retained a US:DS ratio of about 0-8:1 
throughout the range of flight modes. A high US:DS ratio has been recorded in 
other hovering animals (Ellington, 1984a, part III). Pachliopta and Graphium 
were probably the most accurate and frequent hoverers. Troides was rarely 
recorded hovering; the analysed sequence shows a shallow stroke plane as is 
consistent with the reduction in stroke plane angle with flight speed recorded 
above. 

Take-off and climb 

All species were capable of high non-dimensional flight speeds during take-off 
and rapid climbs: Papilio was the slowest, Graphium and Idmon the fastest by far. 
The latter two species stand out by having such high mean angular wing velocities 
during take-off and hovering - between two and five times as high as any of the 
other species. 

Aerodynamic considerations 

Despite notable recent advances (Weis-Fogh, 1973; Ellington, 1978, 19846; 
Rayner, 1979) there is still much to be learnt about the aerodynamics of flapping 
flight. The clap-and-fling mechanism of Weis-Fogh (1973) is now well known. 
Ellington (19846) presents some additional aerodynamic lift-generating mechanisms 
for some insects for which the 'quasi-steady assumption' (where instantaneous 
forces generated by a moving wing are explained in terms of a 
conventional steady, not-flapping, aerofoil) fails. These mechanisms all rely on 
vortex shedding during rotational motion of the wing at stroke extremes. The 
'peel' and 'partial peel' rely on the wings meeting and then moving rapidly apart, 
leading edge first, creating circulation about each wing. The large stroke 
amplitude and wing deformations seen during sequences of hovering, slow 
forward and fast forward flight in Precis, Graphiuml and Graphium4, and 
especially Idmon, suggest they may be using the peel or partial peel to generate lift 
at stroke reversal. Bocharova-Messner & Aksyuk (1982), studying the flight of 
Gonopteryx rhamni, have also suggested that the wing alignment when the wings 
meet at stroke extremes creates a 'tunnel', which could act as a funnel for the 
production of 'jet-forces'. The attitude of the wings at stroke reversal would direct 
the action of the aerodynamic forces generated in this way and so determine the 
relative proportion of lift and thrust components. 

The quasi-steady assumption may be enough to explain the flight of many 
animals (although the use of alternative mechanisms can never be ruled out) and 


284 C. R. BEITS AND R. J. WOOTTON 

may be adequate for the low-frequency, large-amplitude wing beats exhibited by 
most butterflies. Rotational mechanisms may also be operating, particularly in 
those butterflies where strong wing twisting is observed (e.g. Pachliopta, Graphium, 
Idmon). 

The vertical stroke plane seen in Pieris during take-off and hovering (Ellington, 
1984ft) has also been seen in some film sequences of Pachliopta, Graphium and 
Papilio and during fast forward flight in Precis. In the case of Precis and Pachliopta 
in particular, the insect gives the appearance of rowing through the air (similar to 
that seen in Heteroptera; Betts, 1986c). A pressure-drag mechanism of force-
generation proposed by Ellington (19846) is used to explain this phenomenon. 
Film of Pieris flying in the wild shows that, like the other species, it does not always 
employ a vertical stroke plane and a large stroke amplitude during fast forward 
flight; and it may well prove to be similarly variable when hovering, using inclined, 
vertical or horizontal stroke planes. 

Many butterflies use a 'flap-glide' technique where fast forward flight is 
interspersed with significant periods of gliding. This is rarely used by other insects 
(Kingsolver, 1985) although recorded for locusts by Baker & Cooter (1979) and for 
some dragonflies. Butterflies may be able to optimize their gliding performance by 
smoothing the airflow over their wings. Martin & Carpenter (1977) established 
empirically that the wing 'tails' of some species enhanced the airflow over the wing 
surface by stabilizing the shed tip-vorticity. In their experiments, Martin & 
Carpenter used specimens and scale models with linked wings acting as single 
aerofoils. In all the gliding sequences analysed here the wings of each specimen 
appeared to be unlinked during gliding (Fig. 6). By permitting airflow between the

showing the unlinked fore- and hindwings. Its direction of motion is indicated by the 
arrow.

fore- and hindwings, the flow over the whole aerofoil may perhaps be improved by 
a slotting effect, delaying stalling at low speeds and/or high angles of attack. 

Flight behaviour and wing form 
Predictions 

Our knowledge of the relationship between wing shape and flight performance 
in animals comes mainly from birds and bats (e.g. Norberg, 1981; Norberg & 
Rayner, 1987; Rayner, 1987). Butterfly wing planforms are very different from 
those of vertebrates; their wing loadings are several orders of magnitude lower, 
and they probably make far more use of non-steady aerodynamic mechanisms. 
Nonetheless, it is useful to list some simple predictive generalizations, based on 
theory and on vertebrate studies, against which our observations can be tested. 

In general, high wing loading is associated with fast flight, low wing loading with 
slow flight and sometimes hovering. A high aspect ratio goes with power economy; 
low aspect ratios allow low loadings in comparatively short wings, when there are 
environmental constraints on span, or advantages in minimizing inertial and 
bending moments. 

A low moment of inertia (second moment of mass) tends to minimize power 
consumption in flapping flight, and may also aid agility - particularly in animals 
where direction changes and accelerations occur in the course of one or two wing 
beats. 

In butterflies it might therefore be expected that: (1) short, broad (low AR) 
wings would favour slow, agile flight, and would be common among forms that 
frequently fly in restricted spaces or dense vegetation; (2) long, slender (high AR) 
wings would be associated with species that fly extensively, but available speeds 
would depend on wing loading, which would be low in forms that hover frequently 
and high in species that fly fast and use shallow glides; (3) forewings with 
extended, narrow tips would gain some of the benefits of a high aspect ratio while 
maintaining reasonably low moments of area and mass, and hence high agility. 

Conclusions 

How far do our results (Tables 1, 2) match these predictions? 

Troides radamantus consistently performed prolonged, fast flights, travelling the 
full expanse of the area, occasionally climbing or visiting flowers, but rarely 
hovering or executing rapid manoeuvres. This fits well with predictions: the high 
aspect ratio and high wing loading together favouring fast extended flight, and the 
high moment of wing inertia discouraging manoeuvrability and hovering. However, 
the insects may not have shown their full range of flight patterns in the rather 
small enclosure. In Malaysia, Troides ?helena flew similarly, but seemed to glide 
more frequently and for greater distances (original observation); and males of this 
species have been seen performing fast turns and accurate hovering during sexual 
display (R. Vane-Wright, personal communication). But in general fast, pro

longed, relatively unmanoeuvrable flight seems to be characteristic of many 
birdwing butterflies. In Malaysia, Trogonoptera brookiana males (AR = 5) appeared 
to fly even faster than Troides, at steady speeds along uniform paths 
performing occasional steep climbs and tight turns. 

Papillo rumanzovia, superficially rather similar in size and shape to Troides but 
with a markedly lower wing loading and moment of wing inertia, presents a nice 
contrast in flight pattern, which fits well with expectation. The individuals studied 
flew more slowly and with far greater manoeuvrability, showing rapid accelerations 
and extended tight turns, and hovering at flowers. 

Pachliopta hector is a smaller species - about half the mass and wing area of 

P. rumanzovia and so with a similar wing loading - and has a lower moment of 
wing inertia. The aspect ratio is distinctly lower than that of the intact Papilio; but 
the moments of area are higher, probably reflecting the elongate and rather broad 
forewing, and illustrating the limitations of describing butterfly wing shape solely 
in terms of aspect ratio. The manoeuvrability, generally low flight speed, and 
frequent hovering conform with predictions, but the insect was capable on 
occasion of flying nearly as fast as Troides. 
The wing area of Graphium sarpedon is about 17 % lower than that of 
Pachliopta, and the wing loading of the intact male was markedly higher. Aspect 
ratio and area moments are similar despite the obvious difference in shape: the 
forewing has a narrower elongate tip, and the hindwing no tail. The moments of 
inertia are far lower, reflecting the basal concentration of wing mass. 

The flight of Graphium was very different from the other species studied. Both 
in the enclosure and in the wild it was a fast, agile flier capable of repeated rapid 
manoeuvres and skilful accurate hovering. Individuals often settled, and executed 
short, fast flights between perches- as did the smaller nymphalid, Polyura, which 
occurs in the same situations. Polyura has broader wings than Graphium, but 
shares the conspicuously narrow and produced forewing tip. 

Again performance matches well with expectation, particularly with prediction 
3 above. The high wing loading conforms with the generally rapid flight, and low 
moment of wing inertia with manoeuvrability and frequent hovering. 
Interestingly, wing clapping and the high angular accelerations at stroke reversal 
tended to fray the lightly constructed distal margins, so that it was possible to 
monitor the effect of a more-or-less isometric reduction in wing area. Loss of 25 % 
of the wing of Graphium?) increased the beat frequency, lowered the speed, and 
reduced the capacity to hover and turn accurately, and prevented sustained flight. 

Precis iphita has a low aspect ratio and high area moments: it is broad-winged, 
with a large distal chord. The filmed individual flew with a lower beat frequency 
and mean angular velocity than did Graphium, using its short, stiff wings for rapid 
manoeuvring and extended slow glides - predictable from the wing shape - but was 
capable of remarkable and unexpected bursts of speed, using a steep stroke plane 
and a sharply increased amplitude and frequency. 

Hesperiidae (skippers) are taxonomically and morphologically distinct frorri 
other butterflies. Most are small, though some approach hawk-moth size and look 


Butterfly flight 

rather similar, but with broader wings. Idmon's aspect ratio is moderate, with a 
large distal chord. We have no figure for wing-loading, but the bodies are stout and 
values are probably high. 

Skippers are capable of very fast flight, are extremely manoeuvrable, and hover 
well. In Malaysia Idmon was difficult to follow in flight: it may not have reached 
full speed on film. The wing bases are stout, and the tips are strongly deformed at 
stroke reversal; this is not surprising since the mean angular velocities reached are 
comparable with those of some asynchronous flight systems (Betts, 1986b). The 
unremarkable value for wing beat frequency is misleading, since one wing beat 
occupied only 20 ms followed by a delay of about 40 ms before the next 
downstroke. Throughout this interval the skipper was propelled forward with 
wings closed over its abdomen. Manoeuvres could be accurately performed within 
a half-stroke. 

In summary, the flight patterns of the butterflies studied broadly agree with 
predictions based on theory and on experience of the effects of wing loading, 
aspect ratio and wing inertial moments in vertebrates. However, this is clearly a 
simplistic approach. Butterflies sometimes perform in unexpected ways: witness 
the bursts of high-speed flight in Precis and Pachliopta, and the hovering of male 
Troides in courtship. There is an overall impression of great versatility, with 
individuals being capable of switching between flight modes and manoeuvres by 
startling shifts in frequency, amplitude and stroke plane angle, in a manner quite 
unlike that of most insects whose flight has been investigated. Inter- and 
intraspecific differences in kinematic parameters suggest that a wide variety of 
aerodynamic tricks are in use, whose implications on wing design are quite 
unknown. 

The quantitative description of wing form remains a problem. Aspect ratio, a 
mainstay of bird and bat morphometrics, is evidently quite inadequate to describe 
the complex shapes of butterfly wings. Non-dimensional moment parameters are 
far more promising, though still imperfect, and other measures of shape may be 
devised. However described, the significance of wing form will only emerge 
through multivariate analysis of the flight and morphology of a wide range of 
species, and from a rigorous study of their aerodynamics. Both are now under 
way.
