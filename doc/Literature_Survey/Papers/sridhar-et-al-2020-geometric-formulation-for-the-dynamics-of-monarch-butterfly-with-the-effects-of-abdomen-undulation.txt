simplified formulation where the nonlinear time-varying flapping dynamics are transformed into linear time-invariant 
systems by considering small perturbations averaged over the period of flapping [28–31]. These approaches are not 
suitable to analyze the low-frequency flapping dynamics of Monarch butterflies. 

A key open research question associated with the butterfly flight is the effects of dynamics on the power 
consumption. Whereas the pitching motion of smaller flying insects play a critical role in aerodynamic force 
generation [8, 17], most butterfly wings are structurally restricted from pitching [25]. Instead, it is presumed that 
the relatively large aerodynamic forces generated by the simple flapping wing motions affect the body attitude and 
vertical displacement, which alter the effective angle of attack and, hence, the flapping wing aerodynamics. As such, 
by adjusting the center of mass, a butterfly inspired ornithopter without a tail could fly forward passively without a 
feedback controller [25]. If the forward flight of butterflies were indeed passive, the power consumption is expected 
to be lower than an actively controlled flight. The power savings due to coupled wing-body motion can contribute 
to our understanding of the long-range Monarch migration [32], which, in turn, can inform the development of 
long-range micro flying robots. However, there are also reports that contradict these findings: butterfly’s flight under 
periodic flapping motion is unstable because the butterfly cannot maintain its body pitch angle within a proper range 
[33, 34]. The motion of the abdomen had to be actively controlled to stabilize the butterfly flight [34]. 

The objective of this paper is to derive, validate, and analyze a dynamic model that can characterize the Monarch 
butterfly flight. We model a flapping wing aerial vehicle as articulated rigid bodies, where two wings and an abdomen 
are connected to a thorax via spherical joint. An intrinsic form of Lagrangian mechanics is developed to include and 
study the inertial effects of the relative rotation between each part. These are developed on the nonlinear configuration 
manifold in a global fashion such that large angle rotational maneuvers can be analyzed without singularities and 
ambiguities inherent to the common attitude parameterizations. Further, this yields an elegant, structured form of the 
equations of motion that can be easily utilized in stability analysis and controller design. 

Next, to model the flapping wing aerodynamics, a quasi-steady blade element model is formulated without relying 
on the common assumption that the flapping frequency is sufficiently large. For butterfly flights, the aerodynamic 
forces generated by the wing vary along the spanwise direction as the velocity generated by the flapping is comparable 
to the velocity of the thorax. We find the expression for the angle of attack at each infinitesimal chord of the wing 
as a function of the wing kinematics and the rotation and translation of the body, and it is utilized to compute the 
aerodynamic forces and moments. 

In short, the proposed dynamic model captures the unique characteristics of the butterfly flight dynamics where 
the flapping of large wings are coupled with the thorax and the abdomen undulation. More specifically, it can 
represent the effects of the mass distribution of the relatively large wing, the inertial coupling with the abdomen 
undulation, and the low frequency flapping aerodynamics coupled with the body motion. 

Finally, the results of this model are compared to the detailed motion of the thorax, abdomen, and the pair of 
wings of freely flying Monarch butterflies. The live Monarch butterfly flight is measured using a motion-tracking 
system [24], and the corresponding wing kinematics and the body undulations are extracted. It is illustrated that 
the simulation results constructed from the measured wing kinematics are consistent with the experimental results. 
Further we perform several numerical simulations to study the butterfly flight dynamics. Our results show that the 
trajectory of the velocity asymptotically converges to a periodic orbit, suggesting that the flapping motion captured by 
the Monarch butterfly yields an asymptotically stable periodic solution. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the 
abdomen undulation as measured by the live Monarch butterfly increases the forward flight velocity and the climb 
rate, against the other cases of fixed abdomen or undulation in the opposite phase. The role of abdomen undulation in 
the stability of attitude dynamics has been presented in [35]. The presented results suggest that the abdomen may 
have another desirable effects on the translational dynamics of butterfly flight. 

II. Flapping Wing Aerial Vehicle Model for Butterfly 
In this section, we present a flapping wing aerial vehicle model that may characterize the flight of a butterfly. It is 
composed of a head, a thorax, an abdomen, and two wings attached to the thorax via spherical joints. We assume that 
the head and the thorax are coagulated into a single rigid body, which is referred to as body. Also, we assume that 
hindwings move in unison with forewings. 

Here we present a mathematical description for the kinematics of the proposed articulated rigid body model. 
Define an inertial frame FI 
= 
fix, 
iy, 
iz 
g, where the third axis points downward, and the first two axes span the 
horizontal plane (Fig. 1). This is compatible to the NED (north-east-down) frame common in flight dynamics.

fbx,

g, whose origin is located at its mass center of the body (Fig. 1). 
Following the common convention in flight dynamics, the first axis points toward the head, the second axis point 
toward the right wing, and the third axis points toward the ventral (belly) side.

The location of the mass center of the body is given by x

B. Wing 
Right Wing Let FR 
= 
frx, 
ry, 
rz 
gbe the frame fixed to the right wing (Fig. 2). Its origin is located at the joint of 
the right wing, or the wing root where the right wing is attached to the thorax. The vector from the origin of FB 
to 
the origin of FR 
is defined as R 
2R3. As it is resolved in FB 
and the body is rigid, we have ÛR 
= 
0. The first two 
axes of FR 
span the plane of the wing, where the first axis points toward the leading edge and the second axis points 
toward the wing tip. Consequently, the third axis is normal to the wing plane, and it points toward the ventral side 
when there is no rotation of the right wing. 
Next, we introduce the stroke frame FS 
= 
fsx, 
sy, 
sz 
g, which is constructed by translating the origin of FB 
to the 
center of the left wing root and the right wing root, and rotating it about by 
by β 
2»􀀀, 
º(Fig. 3). The y–z 
plane of 
FS 
is referred to as the stroke plane. 

The angle β 
can be considered as the angle between bx 
, and sx 
that is normal to the stroke plane. Or equivalently, 
it is the angle between y–z 
plane of FB 
and the stroke plane. It is positive when sx 
bz 
< 
0. This angle is often 
defined as the angle between the ground (horizontal plane) and the stroke plane, considering hovering flights with a 
fixed attitude of the body. Here, it is defined relative to FB 
as the flapping motion is inherently relative to the body. 

The motion of the right wing relative to FS 
is described by 1–3–2 Euler angles ¹R; R;Rº(Fig. 4). Consequently, 
the orientation of the right wing relative to FB, namely QR 
2SO¹3ºis described by 

QR¹tº= 
exp¹eˆ2ºexp¹R¹tºeˆ1ºexp¹􀀀 R¹tºeˆ3ºexp¹R¹tºeˆ2º,

which is the linear transformation of a representation of a vector from FR 
to FB. The Euler-angles are defined as

As given by (3), the three-dimensional attitude of the right wing is parameterized by four angles, and as such there 
is a redundancy in defining the stroke plane. In general, the deviation angle is relatively small for most of insects. In 
particular, when  R 
is exactly zero, the stroke plane is defined such that it is spanned by the motion of the wing tip. If 
the deviation angle is not zero, then the stroke plane can be chosen such that the distance between the wing tip and the

where 
R 
2R3 is the angular velocity of the right wing relative to FB

The determinant of the above 3 3 matrix is 􀀀cos  R. Consequently, it is invertible when the deviation angle satisfies 
 R

π 
2 . This is not restrictive as the deviation angle is small in general. 

Left Wing Similarly, let FL 
be the frame fixed to the left wing (Fig. 5). It can be obtained by translating FR 
to the 
root of the left wing without any rotation. More specifically, its origin is located at the joint of the left wing, where 
the left wing is attached to the thorax. The first two axes span the plane of the wing, where the first axis points toward 
the leading edge and the second axis points toward the right wing, opposite to the left wing tip. Consequently, the 
third axis is normal to the wing plane, and it points toward the ventral side when there is no rotation of the left wing.

Wing Kinematics Let f

be the frequency of the flapping in Hz. Thus, the period of the flapping is T 
=

f 


The variation of the Euler angles over the flapping period is often referred to as wing kinematics, and several models 
have been presented to construct ¹¹tº;¹tº; ¹tºº[36]. These can substituted into (3) and (6) to describe the attitude 
of the wing as a function of time.

C. Abdomen 
Consider an abdomen that is assumed to be a rigid body attached to the thorax via a spherical joint. Let 
FA 
= 
fax, 
ay, 
az 
gbe the frame fixed to the abdomen. Its origin is located at the mass center of the abdomen, and 
its orientation is identical to FB 
when there is no rotation relative to the body. The vector from the origin of FB 
to 
the joint connecting the thorax and the abdomen is A 
2R3. As it is resolved in FB 
and the body is rigid, we have ÛA 
= 
0. 

The motion of the abdomen relative to the body is described by QA 
2SO¹3º, which is the linear transformation 
of the representation of a vector from FA 
to FB. Its time-derivative is given by 

QÛ
A 
= 
QA
ˆ A, 
(9) 

where 
A 
2R3 is the angular velocity of the abdomen relative to the body, resolved in FA. 

III. Quasi-Steady Aerodynamics 
The quasi-steady assumption implies that the aerodynamic force and moment generated by the flapping wing are 
equivalent to those for steady motion at the same instantaneous velocity and the angle of attack. In this section, we 
propose a quasi-steady aerodynamic model for the butterfly flights characterized by relatively slow flapping of large 
wings. Without relying on the common assumption that the flapping frequency is sufficiently large, an expression 
for the translational forces and the rotational force is presented. This accounts the effects of the translational and 
rotational motion of the body, and the wind gust in the aerodynamic force. 

A. Wing Morphological Parameters 
rx
ryc¹rºdrr
Fig. 6 Infinitesimal wing segment. 

We first present several morphological parameters of the wing as formulated in to [37], after making a few changes 
in the notation. More specifically, in [37], the symbol ^is used to denote normalized variables. However, the same 
symbol is used for the hat map in (2). Instead, we use the symbol ˜ for the normalized variables to avoid conflict 
with (2). Also, the morphological parameters are defined for a single wing as the aerodynamic force of the left wing 
will be distinguished from the right wing for non-symmetric flapping. 

Let dr 
be the infinitesimal wing segment located distanced at r 
from the wing root (Fig. 6). Let its chord 
be defined as c¹rº. The wing segment is parallel to rx 
and the distance is measured along ry 
. Assume that the 
aerodynamic center of the segment is along ry 
, i.e., the resultant force generated by the wing segment is located along 
ry 
with zero moment. Consequently, it is located at re2 when resolved in FR. 

The area of the right wing is given by 

¹

where l

Next, when a wing is accelerated, it causes the motion of the surrounding air. The inertia of the wing is increased 
by the mass of air that is accelerated, and therefore there is an increase in the wing mass. The normalized virtual

where ρ

The direction of the lift is normal to both of the velocity UR¹rºand the wing span-wise direction e2. As such, the 
direction of the lift is along e2 UR¹rºin FR. The ambiguity of the sign can be resolved by the fact that when the 
rx

, the velocity vector U¹rºand the lift vector occupy the opposite side with 
each other.

D. Rotational Force 
The wing’s own rotation may cause additional circulation about the chord that generate a normal force. This is 
referred to as a rotational force [38]. The expression of the rotational force of the right wing is identical to that of the 
left wing, except the flipped sign in the corresponding moment. As such, in this section, we do not distinguish the 
right wing from the left wing with the subscript R. 

According to [38], the magnitude of the rotational lift for the infinitesimal wing segment is given by 

kU¹rºkCrotjÛ¹rºjc2¹rºdr, 
(33) 

where the last part CrotjÛ¹Rºjc2 corresponds to the rotational circulation. The time-derivative of the angle of attack

To avoid singularity caused by , the first expression is used when α 
is close to π

used when α 
is close to 0. Also, to mitigate the singularity caused by kUk1, we evaluate kUkÛα 
in the numerical 
implementation, instead of computing Û 
directly. 

Next, we find the direction of the rotational lift. It is shown that the rotational lift is always perpendicular to 
the chord line, and consequently it is e3 in FR. Consider the four cases of > 
0 illustrated in Fig. 7. For the first 
two cases of eT

For the case of α

IV. Dynamics of Flapping Wing Aerial Vehicle for Butterfly 
In this section, we construct the equations of motion for the dynamics of the proposed flapping wing aerial 
vehicle model. To objective is to capture the inertial coupling between the thorax, the abdomen, and the wings such 
that the dynamics of butterfly is properly represented. It is based on the geometric formulation of the multibody 
dynamics [39] to describe the dynamics in an intrinsic, elegant fashion. 

A. Lagrangian Mechanics on a Lie Group 
We first present the Lagrangian mechanics for an arbitrary mechanical system evolving on a Lie group. The 
Euler–Lagrange equations are developed when the Lagrangian is composed of a kinetic energy with a configuration-
dependent inertia and a potential energy. This result will be utilized later for the proposed flapping wing aerial 
vehicle. 

Consider a dynamic system evolving on an abstract Lie group G. The kinematics equation on G 
is given by 

gÛ 
= 
g, 
(39) 

for ξ 
2g 
corresponding to the left-trivialized velocity. Consequently the tangent bundle TG 
is identified with G 
g. 



Let J 
: G 
g 
!g 
be a symmetric, positive-definite inertia tensor, i.e., 

hJg¹º;i0, 


hJg¹º;i= 
0 ⇔ 
ξ 
= 
0, 


hJg¹1º;2i 
= 
hJg¹2º;1i, 




for any g 
2G 
and , 
1;2 2g. Also, define ¹Kg¹ºº¹º: G 
g 
!g 
such that 

Te 
Lg 
DgJg¹º· 
χ 
= 
¹Kg¹ºº¹º= 
Kg¹º. 
(40) 

It is straightforward to Kg¹ºis a linear operator. Therefore, by selecting a basis of g, Kg¹ºcan be represented by a 
matrix. Intuitively, it is the left-trivialize derivative of Jg¹ºwith respect to g. 
Suppose that the Lagrangian L

B. Lagrangian Mechanics of Flapping Wing Aerial Vehicle 
The configuration of the given flapping wing vehicle model is described by g 
= 
¹x, 
R, 
QR, 
QL, 
QAº. Consequently, 
the configuration space is a Lie group G 
= 
R3SO¹3º4. As it is a product of R3 and four copies of SO¹3º, the Lie algebra 
is simply g 
= 
R3 so¹3º4 'R3 ¹R3º4. The kinematics equation is identical to (39) with ξ 
= 
¹Ûx,

R, 

L, 

Aº2g. 

Kinetic Energy The kinetic energy of the body is given by 

11

TB 
= 
2mB 
kxÛk2 + 
2
T 
JB
. 
(42) 

where mB 
2R 
is the mass of the body, and JB 
2R33 is the inertia matrix of the body about FB. 

Next, we find the expression for the kinetic energy of the wings and the abdomen. The contribution of the left 
wing is identical to the right wing and the abdomen, as all of them are essentially a rigid body connected to the thorax 
via a spherical joint. Therefore, we use the subscript i 
2fR, 
L, 
Agto denote the variables related to a particular wing 
or the abdomen, which is referred to as Bi 
. 

Consider a mass element dm 
in Bi 
, whose location is given by ν 
2R3 in Fi 
, i.e., ν 
is the vector from the joint to 
the mass element resolved in Fi 
. Thus, its location from the origin of the inertial frame, resolved in the inertial frame 
FI 
is x

Ri 
+ 
RQi 
, and its velocity is 

xÛ+ 
R
ˆ ¹i 
+ 
Qi 
º+ 
RQi 

ˆ i

Therefore, the kinetic energy is

Thus i

matrix of Bi 
about the origin of Fi

The wing shape and chord are determined from an example butterfly specimen shown in Fig. 9. The location of 
the leading edge and the trailing edge are measured along the span-wise direction, and they are fitted by sixth-order 
polynomials. The resulting measurements and the fitted curve are illustrated in Fig. 9. From the fitted chord, we 
determine the morphological dimensions related to the wing shown in Table 1. The mass of the wing and body 
segments and dimensions related to the butterfly body were calculated based on avergage values from six butterfly 
specimens and are shown in Table 1. 

For the calculation of the inertia matrix, the head/thorax is considered as a cylinder with the height hB 
and the 
diameter wB. The moment of inertia of the body about its center of gravity is

B. Flight Characteristics of Monarch 
The flight of an actual Monarch butterfly is studied by a motion capture system. The twelve markers are attached 
to a Monarch as illustrated in Fig. 10(a), and the position of each marker is measured by a VICON motion capture 
system at 200 Hz. 

These are converted into ¹x, 
R, 
QR, 
QL, 
QAºas follows. It is considered that the origin of the body, namely x, is 
located at the center of T1 and T2. For the body attitude R, it is assumed that the first axis is along T1 􀀀T2 and the 
second axis is parallel to the ground, i.e., there is no body roll. This is reasonable as the measured flight trajectory is 
almost straight. For the attitude of the abdomen, the first axis points from the center of A1 and A2 toward T2, and the 
second axis is parallel to the ground. The resulting rotation matrix is left multiplied by RT 
to obtain the relative 
attitude QA. 

For the right wing attitude, it is assumed that the wing root is located at the center of T1 and T2. The wing plane 
always passes through the wing root exactly, and it is spanned by the three markers on the right wing. However, due 
to the measurement errors and the flexibility of the wing, those points do not exactly lie on a single plane. Instead, we 
find the normal vector of the plane such that the sum of the squared distance between each marker and the plane is 
minimized. The normal vector yields the third axis of FR. For the second axis, the vector from the wing root to RW3

is projected on to the fitted plane. The first axis is determined by the cross product of the second axis and the third 
axis. These yield the rotation matrix of the right wing from the inertial frame, and by left multiplying RT 
, we obtain 
QR. The attitude of the left wing, namely QL 
is constructed similarly. 

Next, the computed ¹QR¹tº, 
QL 
¹tººare converted into wing kinematics angles as follows. First, we determine the 
wing stroke plane. In the absences of the deviation angle  , the second column of QR¹tºand QL 
¹tºover multiple time 
instances span the stroke plane. We find the stroke plane such that the sum of the squared distance for QR¹tºe2 and 
QL 
¹tºe2 for varying t 
over the experiment period is minimized. It turns out that the normal vector to the stroke plane 
is not in the bx 
–bz 
plane. More explicitly, it is given by »􀀀0:8948, 
􀀀0:1222, 
0:4294¼, i.e., it is rotated by 􀀀7:77 deg 
when observed the dorsal side, or the right wing tip is ahead of the left wing tip (Fig. 11(a)). This might have 
been caused by the asymmetry of the particular Monarch butterfly used in the experiment, or the bias in the marker 
attachment. Instead of dealing with the asymmetry in the left wing and the right wing, we multiply exp¹7:77eˆ3ºto QR 
and QL 
such that they become symmetric in the least square sense. The resulting normal vector of the stroke plane 
lies in the bx 
–bz 
plane, and the stroke plane angle is β 
= 
25:42 deg. From the given , and rotated QR¹tº, 
QL 
¹tº, 
we can determine the wing kinematics angles ¹R¹tº;R¹tº; R¹tº, and ¹L 
¹tº;L 
¹tº; L 
¹tººaccording to (3) and (6), 
respectively. These are illustrated in Fig. 11(b). The wing kinematics angles for the right wing are mostly consistent 
with the the left wing, except the small deviation angle. Assuming the symmetric wing kinematics, we take the 
average between the right wing and the left wing, and they are fitted with Fourier series to be used in the subsequent 
dynamic simulation. 

C. Dynamic Simulation 
From the above wing kinematics angles and the body/abdomen attitude obtained by the actual Monarch butterfly, 
we numerically integrate the quasi-steady position dynamics, namely (63). The corresponding results are compared 
against the experimental data. These are illustrated in Fig. 12. In general, the downstrokes generate the lift upward, 
and the upstrokes generate thrust forward, while yielding a climbing trajectory with oscillation. 

The proposed quasi-steady aerodynamic model generates greater lift and thrust, and consequently causing higher 
climb rate and forward velocity. However, it is consistent with the experimental data in a qualitative manner, thereby 
validating the proposed model. 

D. Effects of Abdomen 
It turns out that for Monarch butterfly flights, the abdomen oscillate at the same frequency of the wing flapping 
angle with the opposite phase, i.e., the abdomen rotates downward during the wing upstrokes. 

To test the effects of abdomen undulation with the proposed model, we simulate the above Monarch model for 50 
strokes while fixing the abdomen pitching angle to the averaged value. These results are illustrated at Fig. 13. While 
the difference is not substantial, it is shown that the abdomen undulation slightly increases the climb rate and the 
forward velocity.

by the total mass and subtracted by the gravity. The position is shown in m, velocity in m/s, forces in N, and 
angles in degrees. 

19 


Furthermore, we consider another case when the abdomen undulate in the opposite phase to the measured vales. 
Interestingly, this yields the worst results, where the forward velocity and the climb rate are smaller than the case of 
fixed abdomen. This suggests that the abdomen undulation has a coupling effect to the translational dynamics of the 
thorax, as represented by the additional force in (63),

It is interesting to notice that the Monarch butterfly undulates its abdomen such that the above terms become beneficial 
to the flight. 

E. Asymptotic Stability 
Another interesting results of Fig. 13(c) is that the trajectory of the velocity asymptotically converges to a 
periodic orbit, while the initial condition does not belong to the periodic orbit exactly. This suggests that the flapping 
motion captured by the Monarch butterfly yields an asymptotically stable periodic solution. This should be further 
investigated by dynamic system theory such as Floquet’s theorem. 

VI. Conclusions 
This paper presents a dynamic model for a flapping wing aerial vehicle that can characterize the flight of a 
butterfly. It is composed of articulated rigid bodies such that the dynamic effects of the inertial coupling between 
multiple parts can be studied. A quasi-steady aerodynamic model is also constructed without assuming that the 
flapping frequency is sufficiently large. Consequently, the proposed model is particularly useful for the butterfly flight 
that is characterized by relatively large wings flapping at a low frequency and body/abdomen undulation coupled with 
the flapping motion. 

This proposed model is compared with the data obtained by a live Monarch butterfly. It is shown that the abdomen 
undulation increases the flight velocity, and the flapping of the Monarch butterfly yields an asymptotically stable 
periodic orbit. For future study, the effects of the abdomen undulation should be quantitatively evaluated to compare 
its undulation, and the stability should be rigorously analyzed.
