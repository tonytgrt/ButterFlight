Abstract 


In 
this 
paper 
we 
describe 
a 
physics-based 
method 
for 
synthesis 
of 
bird 
ight 
animations. 
Our 
method 
computes 
a 
realistic 
set 
of 
wing-
beats 
that 
enables 
a 
bird 
to 
follow 
the 
specied 
trajectory. 
We 
model 
the 
bird 
as 
an 
articulated 
skeleton 
with 
elastically 
deformable 
feathers. 
The 
bird 
motion 
is 
created 
by 
applying 
joint 
torques 
and 
aerodynamic 
forces 
over 
time 
in 
a 
forward 
dynamics 
simulation. 
We 
solve 
for 
each 
wingbeat 
motion 
separately 
by 
optimizing 
for 
wing-
beat 
parameters 
that 
create 
the 
most 
natural 
motion. 
The 
nal 
animation 
is 
constructed 
by 
concatenating 
a 
series 
of 
optimal 
wing-
beats. 
This 
detailed 
bird 
ight 
model 
enables 
us 
to 
produce 
ight 
motions 
of 
different 
birds 
performing 
a 
variety 
of 
maneuvers 
including 
taking 
off, 
cruising, 
rapidly 
descending, 
turning, 
and 
landing.

Introduction 


Computer 
animation 
research 
has 
produced 
a 
number 
of 
models 
for 
the 
natural 
motion 
of 
animals. 
Most 
of 
this 
research 
has 
focused 
on 
terrestrial 
animals, 
primarily 
humans 
(e.g. 
[Hodgins 
et 
al. 
1995]). 
Other 
studies 
have 
explored 
the 
motion 
of 
kangaroos 
[Raibert 
and 
Hodgins 
1991], 
snakes 
[Miller 
1988], 
aquatic 
animals 
[Tu 
and 
Terzopoulos 
1994], 
and 
even 
extinct 
and 
imaginary 
animals 
[Sims 
1994]. 


Perhaps 
equally, 
if 
not 
more, 
intriguing 
is 
the 
motion 
of 
animals 
in 
ight. 
Birds 
and 
insects 
are 
both 
among 
the 
most 
frequently 
seen 
wildlife 
in 
our 
everyday 
life. 
The 
ight 
of 
birds 
is 
arguably 
the 
most 
graceful 
and 
expressive 
of 
all 
natural 
motions. 
However, 
modeling 


aerial 
motion 
is 
extremely 
challenging. 
First, 
any 
locomotion 
in 
air 
ows 
or 
other 
environments 
with 
high 
Reynolds 
numbers 
[Abbott 
and 
Basco 
1990] 
presents 
a 
signicant 
simulation 
and 
control 
challenge. 
The 
interaction 
between 
a 
bird's 
wings 
and 
the 
air 
is 
very 
complex. 
The 
forces 
generated 
by 
this 
interaction 
are 
chaotic 
and 
hard 
to 
control. 
The 
simulations 
are 
often 
unstable 
because 
of 
high 
sensitivity: 
the 
slightest 
change 
of 
wing 
position 
during 
down-
stroke 
can 
have 
signicant 
effects 
in 
the 
result 
and 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
bird's 
ight. 
Furthermore, 
the 
specic 
musculoskeletal 
structure 
of 
the 
bird, 
and 
especially 
the 
elastic 
properties 
of 
the 
feathers, 
seem 
to 
greatly 
affect 
not 
only 
a 
bird's 
wingbeat 
pattern 
but 
also 
whether 
the 
bird 
can 
y 
at 
all. 


This 
paper 
addresses 
some 
of 
these 
challenges. 
We 
focus 
on 
the 
problem 
of 
bird 
ight 
synthesis. 
Specically, 
we 
describe 
algorithms 
for 
dynamic 
simulation 
of 
a 
bird 
following 
a 
given 
ight 
trajectory. 
Our 
framework 
can 
generate 
ight 
motions 
for 
different 
birds 
performing 
various 
ight 
maneuvers 
including 
taking 
off, 
cruising, 
rapidly 
descending, 
turning, 
and 
landing. 
These 
motions 
could 
potentially 
be 
used 
in 
animation 
or 
lm 
productions, 
as 
well 
as 
an 
analysis 
tool 
for 
designing 
optimal 
ight 
controllers. 


The 
rest 
of 
the 
paper 
describes 
our 
approach 
in 
more 
detail. 
In 
Section 
2, 
we 
discuss 
related 
work. 
Section 
3 
gives 
a 
short 
overview 
of 
our 
ight 
synthesis 
approach. 
Subsequent 
sections 
describe 
various 
aspects 
of 
our 
algorithms 
in 
more 
detail. 
In 
Section 
7, 
we 
describe 
a 
collection 
of 
example 
animations 
generated 
by 
our 
system. 
Section 
8 
summarizes 
our 
contributions 
and 
outlines 
possible 
future 
research 
directions.

In 
addition 
to 
a 
large 
body 
of 
research 
concerned 
with 
modeling 
realistic 
human 
motion, 
a 
number 
of 
researchers 
have 
focused 
on 
modeling 
other 
animals. 
Miller 
[1988] 
modeled 
locomotion 
of 
snakes 
and 
worms 
using 
mass-spring 
systems. 
Grzeszczuk 
et 
al. 
used 
a 
multi-level 
learning 
technique 
to 
optimize 
and 
choose 
appropriate 
actuators 
and 
controllers 
of 
locomotion 
for 
snakes 
and 
sh 
[Tu 
and 
Terzopoulos 
1994; 
Grzeszczuk 
and 
Terzopoulos 
1995]. 


Birds 
have 
received 
somewhat 
limited 
attention 
within 
the 
computer 
graphics 
community. 
Haumann 
and 
Hodgins 
[1992] 
used 
a 
physics-based 
model 
to 
generate 
the 
hovering 
ight 
of 
hummingbirds. 
Reynolds 
[1987] 
modeled 
the 
group 
behavior 
of 
birds 
by 
modeling 
ocks 
as 
particle 
systems. 
Ramakrishnananda 
and 
Wong 
[1999] 
utilized 
simplied 
aerodynamics 
and 
manually 
tuned 
controllers 
for 
bird 
ight 
animation. 
They 
used 
forward 
kinematics 
in 
their 
simulation, 
omitted 
the 
elbow 
joints, 
and 
simplied 
the 
joint 
movements 
for 
the 
wrists. 
In 
order 
to 
obtain 
more 
realistic 
ight 
behaviors, 
we 
use 
forward 
dynamics 
and 
skeletal 
structures 
that 
fully

on

(SIGGRAPH

reect 
the 
structures 
and 
movements 
of 
a 
bird's 
wings. 
In 
addition, 
we 
use 
simulations 
and 
optimizations 
to 
automatically 
determine 
control 
parameters. 


Full 
dynamics 
simulations, 
together 
with 
robot 
controllers, 
have 
been 
successfully 
used 
for 
synthesis 
of 
human 
motion 
[Hodgins 
and 
Pollard 
1997]. 
Recently 
Faloutsos 
et 
al. 
[2001] 
describe 
a 
controller-based 
approach 
to 
human 
motion 
synthesis 
where 
they 
assume 
the 
availability 
of 
controllers. 
The 
transition 
strategy 
between 
the 
controllers 
is 
learned 
from 
a 
number 
of 
simulation 
trials. 
Unfortunately, 
designing 
controllers 
for 
ight 
presents 
a 
greater 
challenge 
because 
of 
instability 
and 
the 
complexity 
of 
the 
dynamic 
model. 
In 
this 
paper 
we 
draw 
many 
ideas 
from 
the 
controller 
synthesis 
research. 
However, 
we 
sidestep 
the 
problem 
of 
controller 
design 
by 
focusing 
on 
the 
ofine 
motion 
synthesis 
problem 
where 
we 
solve 
for 
each 
optimal 
wingbeat 
separately. 


Our 
wingbeat 
optimization 
approach 
is 
motivated 
by 
the 
work 
of 
Grzeszczuk 
and 
Terzopoulos 
[1995]. 
They 
parameterized 
sh 
and 
snake 
movement 
with 
a 
small 
set 
of 
parameters 
and 
used 
global 
optimization 
methods 
to 
determine 
the 
optimal 
parameters 
that 
would 
enable 
the 
animal 
to 
move 
forward 
and 
turn 
in 
different 
directions. 
Controllers 
for 
turning 
by 
an 
arbitrary 
amount 
are 
subsequently 
constructed 
by 
interpolation 
of 
the 
optimized 
parameters. 
Unfortunately, 
this 
approach 
does 
not 
directly 
apply 
to 
bird 
ight, 
mainly 
owing 
to 
an 
important 
distinction 
between 
bird 
ight 
and 
marine 
locomotion: 
the 
bird 
must 
constantly 
seek 
to 
obtain 
the 
optimal 
lift/drag 
ratio 
to 
counteract 
gravity. 
Thus, 
the 
speed 
is 
much 
more 
important 
in 
the 
case 
of 
bird 
ight 
– 
the 
controller 
strategy 
for 
the 
same 
ight 
maneuver 
performed 
at 
different 
speeds 
can 
be 
drastically 
different. 
Consequently, 
the 
space 
of 
controllers 
or 
wingbeats 
for 
bird 
ight 
is 
signicantly 
larger 
compared 
to 
systems 
with 
lower 
Reynolds 
number 
such 
as 
sh 
swimming 
in 
water. 
For 
the 
same 
reason 
the 
interpolation 
of 
distinctively 
different 
controllers 
also 
does 
not 
apply 
to 
the 
highly 
nonlinear 
space 
of 
bird-ight 
controllers. 


Accurate 
modeling 
of 
the 
aerodynamics 
within 
the 
ight 
simulation 
is 
crucial 
for 
obtaining 
natural-looking 
animation. 
Computational 
uid 
dynamics 
(CFD) 
algorithms 
are 
the 
best 
choice 
in 
terms 
of 
accuracy. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
CFD 
computations 
are 
too 
computationally 
intensive 
for 
the 
controller 
optimization 
framework. 
As 
a 
result, 
we 
turned 
to 
simpler 
and 
commonly 
used 
aerodynamics 
equations. 
Wejchert 
et 
al. 
[1991] 
used 
simplied 
aerodynamics 
for 
the 
design 
and 
control 
of 
animation 
of 
objects 
in 
uid 
and 
airow. 
With 
wind 
tunnel 
experiments 
and 
ow 
visualizations, 
researchers 
in 
biology 
and 
zoology 
have 
studied 
many 
complex 
aerodynamics 
phenomena 
that 
occur 
during 
the 
apping 
ight 
of 
birds 
and 
insects 


(e.g. 
[Norberg 
1990; 
Tobalske 
and 
Dial 
1996; 
Spedding 
1992]). 
Our 
ight 
model 
draws 
greatly 
from 
this 
large 
body 
of 
work.

Overview 


The 
input 
to 
our 
system 
consists 
of 
a 
dynamic 
bird 
model 
and 
a 
ight 
path 
trajectory. 
The 
bird 
model 
includes 
the 
skeletal 
structure, 
mass 
distribution, 
and 
wing 
feather 
specication 
including 
the 
parameters 
describing 
the 
feathers’ 
aerodynamic 
properties. 
We 
have 
created 
a 
number 
of 
such 
models 
from 
the 
data 
available 
in 
the 
biomechanics 
literature. 
We 
group 
all 
degrees 
of 
freedom 
(DOFs) 
for 
the 
bird 
into 
a 
vector 
q. 
This 
vector 
includes 
the 
bird's 
global 
rotation 
and 
translation, 
as 
well 
as 
all 
controllable 
joints 
of 
the 
bird's 
skeleton. 
We 
dene 
the 
simulation 
state 
S 
to 
be 
q 
and 
its 
derivative, 
i.e. 


 


q

S 
= 


q˙ 


The 
desired 
path 
trajectory 
p(s) 
is 
represented 
as 
a 
3D 
spline 
parameterized 
by 
its 
arc 
length 
s 
with 
corresponding 
desired 
velocity 
v(s) 
along 
the 
path. 
By 
adjusting 
the 
path 
and 
the 
velocities, 
the 


animator 
can 
generate 
a 
large 
variety 
of 
aerial 
maneuvers. 
For 
example, 
Figure 
1 
shows 
a 
synthesized 
wingbeat 
during 
the 
takeoff 
motion 
of 
a 
raven. 


Our 
ight 
synthesis 
algorithm 
splits 
the 
entire 
motion 
into 
a 
sequence 
of 
wingbeats. 
During 
each 
wingbeat, 
a 
bird 
aps 
its 
wings 
from 
a 
neutral 
position 
upward, 
then 
downward, 
and 
then 
upward 
to 
the 
neutral 
position 
again. 
Our 
algorithm 
nds 
values 
for 
the 
wing-
beat 
parameters 
u 
that 
enable 
the 
bird 
to 
follow 
the 
specied 
path 
in 
a 
most 
natural 
way. 
These 
parameters 
determine 
the 
desired 
state 
patterns 
q 
(u;t) 
for 
the 
controllable 
DOFs 
during 
the 
wingbeat 
cycle. 
The 
bird's 
motion 
is 
controlled 
by 
a 
proportional-derivative 
(PD) 
controller 
that 
generates 
joint 
torques 
t(u) 
that 
bring 
each 
of 




the 
controllable 
DOFs 
q 
towards 
its 
desired 
state 
q 
. 
The 
torque 
for 
each 
of 
the 
DOFs 
qi 
is 
determined 
by 


� 
� 




ti(u)= 
k1 
qi 
(u;t) 
− 
qi(t)+ 
k2 
qi 
(u;t) 
− 
qi(t) 


The 
two 
constants 
k1 
and 
k2 
depend 
on 
the 
characteristics 
of 
individual 
birds 
and 
individual 
joints. 
In 
addition 
to 
torques, 
the 
wing-
beat 
motion 
is 
also 
affected 
by 
external 
forces 
F. 
These 
forces 
include 
gravity 
and 
all 
the 
aerodynamics 
forces. 
The 
entire 
dynamic 
system 
can 
be 
described 
by 
an 
ordinary 
differential 
equation 


q¨ 
= 
f 
(q, 
q˙ 
, 
F, 
t(u)) 


Then, 
with 
the 
initial 
state 
q0 
and 
q˙ 
0 
we 
can 
describe 
the 
simulation 
state 
at 
time 
t 
as 


 


q(t)

S(q0, 
q˙ 
0, 
F, 
t(u), 
t)= 
(1)

q(t) 


Using 
several 
metrics, 
the 
wingbeat 
objective 
function 
E(S(q0, 
q˙ 
0, 
F, 
t(u), 
t), 
p(s), 
v(s)) 
evaluates 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
simulation 
sequence. 
The 
wingbeat 
optimization 
nds 
the 
optimal 
set 
of 
wingbeat 
parameters 
u 
∗ 
that 
minimizes 
the 
objective 
function 
E, 
i.e. 


∗ 


u 
= 
argmin 
E(S(q0, 
q˙ 
0, 
F, 
t(u), 
t), 
p(s), 
v(s)) 


u 


Once 
we 
have 
found 
the 
optimal 
values 
for 
u, 
we 
can 
use 
the 
simulation 
function 
(in 
equation 
(1)) 
to 
determine 
the 
position 
and 
velocity 
of 
the 
bird 
until 
the 
end 
of 
the 
wingbeat. 
We 
continue 
the 
process 
of 
ight 
synthesis 
by 
solving 
for 
the 
subsequent 
wingbeats 
until 
we 
reach 
the 
end 
of 
the 
path 
trajectory.

Bird 
dynamics 


We 
model 
the 
bird 
as 
a 
hierarchy 
of 
articulated 
links. 
Each 
bird 
has 
11 
articulated 
links, 
21 
joint 
DOFs, 
and 
additional 
DOFs 
for 
exible 
feathers. 
The 
skeletal 
structure 
and 
controllable 
DOFs 
are 
described 
in 
Figure 
2. 


To 
model 
a 
feathered 
exible 
wing, 
each 
of 
the 
ight 
feathers 
is 
attached 
to 
the 
wing 
by 
a 
2-DOF 
joint 
whose 
joint 
angles 
are 
completely 
determined 
by 
the 
shoulder, 
elbow, 
and 
wrist 
joints 
in 
a 
way 
that 
resembles 
that 
of 
the 
ight 
feathers 
of 
real 
birds. 
We 
model 
feathers 
using 
nonlinear 
angular 
springs. 
We 
divide 
the 
vanes 
of 
each 
feather 
into 
several 
consecutive 
polygonal 
segments. 
Each 
segment 
has 
an 
angular 
spring 
at 
its 
root, 
and 
the 
segment 
can 
bend 
around 
the 
spring 
axis. 
Furthermore, 
primary 
ight 
feathers 
rotate 
around 
their 
shafts 
as 
they 
move 
through 
the 
air 
because 
of 
their 
vane 
asymmetry 
(Figure 
3). 
This 
rotation 
or 
twist 
allows 
air 
to 
ow 
through 
the 
gaps 
between 
the 
primary 
feathers 
and 
helps 
to 
reduce 
the 
drag 
during 
upstroke 
[Norberg 
1990]. 
Since 
the 
negligible 
mass 
of 
a 
feather 
would 
result 
in 
stiff 
ODEs 
and 
consequently 
highly 
unstable 
simulations, 
we 
ignore 
the 
mass 
of 
feathers 
and 
model 
them 
as 
completely 
damped 
oscillators 
using 
a 
rst 
order 
differential 
equation, 
where 
the 
bend 
angle 
increases 
asymptotically 
with

4.1 
Wingbeat 
parameterization 
In 
order 
to 
represent 
the 
desired 
DOF 
patterns 
q 
(t) 
for 
a 
wing-
beat, 
we 
use 
a 
set 
of 
wingbeat 
parameters 
u. 
The 
size 
of 
u 
denes 
the 
dimensionality 
of 
the 
search 
space 
for 
the 
optimization 
and 
directly 
impacts 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
optimization 
process. 
It 
is, 
therefore, 
important 
that 
we 
specify 
each 
wingbeat 
using 
as 
few 
parameters 
as 
possible 
while 
still 
giving 
the 
bird 
enough 
maneuverability. 
The 
parameters 
are 
shown 
in 
Table 
1. 
The 
superscripts 
u 
and 
d 
indicate 
upstroke 
and 
downstroke 
parameters. 
Most 
of 
these 
parameters 
are 
replicated 
for 
the 
left 
and 
right 
wings. 
For 
simplicity, 
we 
do 
not 
list 
them 
here 
separately. 
The 
dihedral 
and 
sweep 
angles 
are 
dened 
in 
Figure

These 
parameters 
are 
used 
to

Figure

these 
two 
composite 
functions. 


Based 
on 
observations 
made 
in 
the 
biomechanics 
literature, 
we 
use 
g1 
for 
upper 
arm 
dihedral 
and 
tail 
bend. 
We 
use 
g2 
for 
the 
arm 
sweep, 
arm 
and 
forearm 
twists, 
and 
wing 
spread 
extends. 
We 
provide 
the 
rationale 
for 
the 
specic 
choice 
of 
composite 
functions 
in 
Appendix 
A. 


For 
DOF 
i 
with 
constant 
desired 
state 
such 
as 
tail 
twist 
and 
tail 
spread, 
the 
desired 
state 
is 


∗ 


q 
= 
q 
+(qi 
− 
q 
)u

i 


ii 
m(i) 


The 
mapping 
m(i) 
is 
straightforward 
for 
most 
DOFs, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
the 
wrist 
bend 
and 
elbow 
bend 
DOFs. 
These 
DOFs 
are 
both 
determined 
by 
the 
wing 
spread 
parameters 
u5 
d 
and 
uu 
5 
because 
of 
a 
bird's 
musculoskeletal 
constraints. 
The 
wing 
linkage 
allows 
the 
forearm 
and 
the 
hand 
to 
fold 
and 
unfold 
synchronously 
[Norberg 
1990]. 
As 
the 
wing 
folds, 
it 
also 
causes 
the 
forearm 
to 
rotate 
so 
that 
the 
hand 
is 
depressed 
downward 
[King 
and 
McLelland 
1985]. 
We 
linearly 
decrease 
the 
bounds 
for 
the 
arm 
twist 
depending 
on 
the 
wing 
spread 
parameters 
to 
achieve 
this. 
We 
could 
avoid 
this 
inelegance 
by 
modeling 
the 
complete 
linkage 
system, 
but 
doing 
so 
would 
make 
the 
skeletal 
model 
unnecessarily 
complex 
and 
hinder 
the 
simulation 
performance. 


4.2 
Phase 
transformation 
As 
previously 
dened, 
the 
functions 
g1 
and 
g2 
generate 
wingbeats 
with 
equal 
downstroke 
and 
upstroke 
durations. 
To 
allow

in

We 
then 
use

=

instead

in

and 
g2. 
We 
use 
uα 
and 
uβ 
in 
g1 
and 
g2 
respectively, 
and 
the 
resulting 
wingbeat 
has 
a 
down


ua

stroke/upstroke 
ratio 
of 
. 
Using 
uβ 
in 
addition 
to 
uα 
produces

1􀀀uα 


a 
wider 
variety 
of 
wingbeats 
and 
also 
enables 
the 
optimization 
to 
nd 
a 
better 
timing 
between 
different 
DOFs. 
In 
order 
to 
keep 
DOFs 
synchronized, 
we 
offset 
the 
phase 
of 
any 
q 
∗ 
generated 
using 
g2 
so

i 


that 
its 
midpoints 
of 
upstroke 
and 
downstroke 
coincide 
with 
those 
that 
belong 
to 
DOFs 
generated 
using 
g1. 


4.3 
Wingbeat 
blending 
Functions 
g1 
and 
g2 
are 
intentionally 
designed 
to 
be 
cyclic 
in 
order 
to 
easily 
model 
repetitive 
wingbeats. 
Unfortunately, 
when 
composing 
two 
different 
consecutive 
wingbeats, 
there 
are 
invariably 
C0 
and 
C1 
discontinuities 
at 
the 
time 
of 
transition. 
These 
discontinuities 
will 
result 
in 
drastic 
uctuations 
of 
the 
torques 
from 
the 
PD 
controller. 
We 
deal 
with 
these 
discontinuities 
by 
blending 
the 
desired 
state 
patterns 
near 
the 
transition 
point. 
In 
order 
to 
decouple 
the 
apping 
amplitudes 
between 
adjacent 
wingbeats, 
we 
have 
found 
that 
it 
is 
better 
if 
each 
wingbeat 
starts 
and 
ends 
at 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
upstroke 
because 
that 
is 
when 
the 
wings 
are 
usually 
at 
their 
neutral 
dihedral 
angles. 
In 
other 
words, 
the 
wingbeat 
phase 
starts 
and 
ends 
at 
2(uα 
+ 
1􀀀uα 
)p.

2 


Let 
tT 
denote 
the 
time 
at 
which 
the 
wingbeat 
transition 
occurs 


(i.e. 
when 
the 
rst 
wingbeat 
ends 
and 
the 
second 
wingbeat 
begins). 
We 
blend 
the 
wingbeats 
from 
time 
ts 
= 
tT 
− 
tb 
to 
te 
= 
tT 
+ 
tb. 
As 
seen 
in 
Figure 
6, 
we 
rst 
extend 
q 
(t) 
from 
both 
wingbeats 
into 
the 
neighboring 
regions 
by 
duplicating 
them, 
and 
then 
blend 
them 
as 
in 
[Lee 
and 
Kim 
1995]. 
Note 
that 
unlike 
in 
[Lee 
and 
Kim 
1995] 
where 
they 
directly 
manipulated 
the 
nal 
animation, 
our 
blended 
curves 
represent 
the 
desired 
values 
for 
the 
DOFs 
and 
not 
the 
simulation 
results. 
We 
feed 
the 
blended 
desired 
state 
patterns 
to 
the 
PD 
controller 
to 
generate 
the 
torques 
used 
in 
the 
nal 
simulation. 
Because 
the 
end 
of 
the 
rst 
wingbeat 
is 
changed 
by 
the 
blending, 
we 
back 
up 
and 
start 
the 
simulation 
from 
ts 
when 
we 
optimize 
the 
second 
wingbeat.

Currently, 
the 
only 
external 
force 
modeled 
in 
our 
system 
besides 
gravity 
is 
the 
aerodynamics 
force. 
The

used 
in 
our

is

we 
compute 
lift

for 
every

on 
each 
feather 
using 
the 
area 
of 
the 
segment 
and 
the 
angle 
of

the 
air 
has 
on 
the

The 
measured 
coefcients 
for 
bird 
wings 
are 
only 
available 
for 
limited 
range 
of 
angle 
of 
attack 
(see, 
for 
example, 
[Withers 
1981]). 
More 
extreme 
angles 
of 
attack 
such 
as 
those 
that 
would 
appear 
during 
takeoff 
are 
usually 
outside 
of 
this 
range. 
We 
use 
synthesized 
functions 
to 
produce 
lift 
and 
drag 
coefcients 
at 
any 
particular 
angle 
of 
attack 
while 
maintaining 
their 
characteristics 
within 
the 
range 
where 
measured 
data 
are 
available. 
Simply 
summing 
up 
the 
lift 
and 
drag 
forces 
thus 
derived 
to 
obtain 
the 
forces 
for 
the 
wing 
will 
not 
give 
a 
good 
approximation 
because 
the 
overlap 
of

is 
ignored. 
We 
therefore 
scale 
the 
segment

by 
si

Wingbeat 
optimization 


After 
we 
have 
obtained 
a 
sequence 
of 
simulation 
states 
by 
applying 
the 
wingbeat 
dened 
by 
the 
set 
u 
of 
wingbeat 
parameters, 
we 
use 
the 
objective 
function 
E 
to 
evaluate 
the 
goodness 
of 
motion. 
E 
is 
the 
weighted 
sum 
of 
various 
ight 
metrics 
that 
fall 
into 
two 
groups. 
The 
rst 
group 
evaluates 
how 
close 
the 
bird 
follows 
the 
path 
with 
the 
specied 
velocity 
without 
regard 
to 
the 
smoothness 
of 
the 
motion 
or 
energy 
consumption. 
These 
metrics 
alone 
cannot 
ensure 
that 
the 
motion 
looks 
natural. 
The 
second 
group 
of 
metrics 
measure 
the 
gracefulness 
of 
the 
motion. 
These 
two 
groups 
of 
metrics 
work 
together 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
optimal 
wingbeat 
achieves 
the 
goal 
gracefully. 


5.1 
Objective 
function 
Suppose 
the 
simulation 
for 
the 
wingbeat 
is 
carried 
out 
from 
time 
t0 
to 
the 
end 
of 
the 
wingbeat 
t1. 
Let 
qp 
denote 
the 
position 
of 
the 
gravity 
center 
of 
the 
bird's 
trunk 
and 
the 
quaternion 
qr 
denote 
the 
trunk's 
orientation. 
Let 
p(si) 
denote 
the 
point 
on 
p 
that 
is 
closest 
to 
qp(ti). 
The 
rst 
group 
of 
metrics 
evaluate 
how 
well 
the 
bird 
is 
following 
the 
path 
by 
measuring 
the 
deviation 
of 
the 
nal 
position, 
velocity, 
and 
orientation 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
path: 


Ep 
= 
kqp(t1) 
− 
p(s1)k2 


Ev 
= 
kq˙ 
p(t1) 
− 
v(s1)k2 




Er 
= 
y2(qr(t1), 
q 
(s1))

r 


where 
y(qa, 
qb) 
is 
the 
absolute 
value 
of 
the 
rotation 
angle 
from 
qa 
to 
qb, 
and 
q 
∗ 
is 
the 
desired 
orientation. 
See 
Appendix 
B 
for 
the 


r 
details 
on 
how 
we 
determine 
q 
∗ 
r 
. 


The 
rst 
metric 
from 
the 
second 
group 
penalizes 
non-smooth 
change 
of 
orientation 
and 
larger 
than 
necessary 
angular 
velocity 
at 
any 
instance 
in 
time. 
This 
term 
ensures 
that 
the 
bird 
remains 
as 
stable 
as 
possible 
over 
the 
entire 
duration 
of 
the 
wingbeat: 


 


Z 


Eω 
= 
R2 
gω 
kwkdt 
+(1 
− 
gω 
) 
max(kwk)Dt 
− 
Dψ 


t 


where 
ω 
is 
the 
angular 
velocity 
of 
the 
trunk, 
Dt 
= 
t1 
􀀀t0, 
Dψ 
= 
y(qr(t0), 
q 
(s1)), 
and 
R 
is 
the 
ramp 
function 
dened 
as 


r 


 


0 
x 
< 
0

R(x)= 
(2)

x 
otherwise 


The 
integration 
term 
measures 
the 
overall 
change 
of 
orientation 
within 
the 
wingbeat 
duration. 
We 
also 
measure 
the 
maximum 
angular 
velocity 
to 
discourage 
abrupt 
changes 
in 
orientation. 
The 
constant 
gω 
controls 
the 
relative 
importance 
of 
the 
integration 
and 
the 
maximum 
value 
of 
the 
angular 
velocity. 


Grzeszczuk 
and 
Terzopoulos 
[1995] 
used 
a 
metric 
that 
penalizes 
controller 
actuation 
amplitudes 
and 
their 
variation 
for 
synthesis 
of 
sh 
swimming 
controllers. 
We 
found 
this 
particular 
metric 
insufcient 
for 
bird 
ight. 
Although 
this 
metric 
may 
work 
well 
for 
wing-
beats 
– 
such 
as 
those 
for 
cruising 
and 
soaring 
– 
that 
consume 
less 
energy, 
it 
ghts 
with 
the 
other 
metrics 
(Ep 
and 
Ev 
in 
particular) 
for 
wingbeats 
– 
such 
as 
those 
for 
takeoff 
– 
that 
require 
a 
huge 
amount 
of 
energy. 
In 
order 
to 
devise 
a 
more 
general 
metric 
of 
energy 
consumption, 
we 
turn 
to 
the 
ight 
biomechanics 
literature. 


It 
has 
been 
observed 
that 
the 
twist 
of 
the 
forearm 
which 
rotates 
the 
hand 
and 
hence 
the 
primary 
feathers 
undergoes 
a 
relaxed 
movement 
during 
the 
upstroke 
[Burton 
1990]. 
Minimizing 
the 
torque 
for 
the 
twist 
of 
the 
forearms 
only 
during 
the 
upstroke 
gives 
natural 
looking 
results 
without 
overrestricting 
the 
overall 
torque 
from 
the 
controller. 
Intuitively, 
the 
energy 
spent 
during 
downstroke 
is 
mainly 
governed 
by 
the 
bird's 
need 
to 
maintain 
altitude. 
During 
the 
upstroke 
the 
bird 
has 
signicantly 
more 
freedom 
to 
move 
in 
different 
ways. 
Consequently, 
we 
use 
this 
metric 
to 
minimize 
the 
excessive 
torque 
usage 
during 
upstroke: 


 


Z

Eu 
= 
∑ 
gu 
t2 
j 
u(t)dt 
+(1 
− 
gu) 
max(t2 
j 
u(t))

m2 
uα 
Dt 
t

j2V 


where 
V 
is 
the 
set 
of 
the 
two 
elbow 
twist 
DOFs, 
m 
is 
the 
bird's 
mass, 
and 
u(t) 
is 
1 
during 
upstroke 
and 
0 
otherwise. 
We 
also 
measure 
the 
maximum 
torque 
during 
upstroke 
to 
suppress 
sudden 
actuation 
in 
a 
short 
period 
time, 
which 
will 
not 
be 
accounted 
for 
in 
the 
integration 
term. 


During 
the 
simulation, 
the 
bird 
can 
at 
times 
move 
its 
wings 
backwards 
through 
the 
air. 
Such 
motion 
would 
disturb, 
and 
possibly 
damage, 
the 
ight 
feathers 
of 
a 
real 
bird. 
In 
order 
to 
avoid 
uffing 
the 
feathers” 
during 
ight, 
we 
devise 
an 
additional 
metric. 
Let 
b 
j 
denote 
the 
speed 
feather 
j 
travels 
backward 
through 
the 
air. 
We 


dene 
backward” 
for 
a 
feather 
to 
be 
the 
shaft 
direction 
of 
its 
end 


vane 
segment, 
and 
b 
j 
has 
a 
positive 
value 
when 
feather 
j 
is 
moving 
backward 
and 
0 
if 
not. 
The 
following 
metric 
penalizes 
such 
movement: 


Z

(b2

Ef 
= 
max 
j 
(t))dt 


Dt 
j2F 


where 
F 
is 
the 
set 
of 
ight 
feathers. 
The 
objective 
function 
is 
therefore 
the 
weighted 
sum

5.2 
Optimization 
process 
We 
use 
a 
standard 
simulated 
annealing 
process 
[Kirkpatrick 
et 
al. 
1983] 
to 
optimize 
the 
wingbeat 
parameters. 
At 
each 
iteration, 
we 
generate 
a 
new 
set 
of 
wingbeat 
parameters 
by 
randomly 
picking 
a 
parameter 
from 
u 
and 
then 
offsetting 
it 
by 
a 
random 
amount 
to 
obtain 
a 
new 
set 
of 
parameters. 
We 
then 
run 
the 
simulation 
using 
the 
new 
wingbeat 
and 
use 
E 
to 
evaluate 
the 
goodness 
of 
the 
motion. 
Each 
wingbeat 
requires 
1000 
iterations. 
We 
use 
a 
geometric 
cooling 
schedule 
and 
the 
annealing 
temperature 
is 
reduced 
by 
10% 
every 
100 
iterations.

Putting 
it 
all 
together 


When 
the 
bird's 
position 
diverges 
from 
the 
path, 
v(s) 
may 
only 
allow 
the 
bird 
to 
travel 
in 
parallel 
with 
p(s). 
Returning 
to 
the 
path 
and 
maintaining 
the 
desired 
velocity 
become 
conicting 
goals. 
We 
therefore 
dene 
a 
merging 
path 
p0(s) 
with 
new 
velocity 
v0(s) 
that 
allows 
the 
bird 
to 
gradually 
return 
to 
the 
original 
path. 
The 
new 
velocities 
still 
have 
the 
same 
magnitude 
but 
have 
directions 
tangential 
to 
the 
new 
path. 
We 
then 
use 
p0(s) 
and 
v0(s) 
instead 
of 
p(s) 
and 
v(s) 
in 
the 
objective 
function. 


Dene 
tb(u0,

to 
be 
the 
joint 
torques 
the 
PD 
controller 
generates 
from

the 
two 
sequential 
wingbeats. 
For 
simplicity, 
we 
also 
dene 
tb(null, 
u1)= 
t(u1). 
The 
entire 
ight 
synthesis 
process 
can 
be 
described 
as 
a 
set 
of 
iterated 
stages:

The 
full 
animation 
of

bird's 
ight

simulation

all 
wingbeats 
performed 
sequentially.

Results 


To 
demonstrate 
the 
capability 
of 
our 
system, 
we 
create 
three 
bird 
models 
of 
different 
dimensions 
and 
weights, 
approximating 
an 
eagle, 
raven 
and 
a 
sparrow. 
We 
also 
create 
several 
paths 
that 
require 
the 
birds 
to 
do 
different 
maneuvers. 
Figure 
9 
shows 
the 
animation 
sequences 
for 
these 
three 
birds. 


We 
test 
our 
method 
by 
requiring 
each 
bird 
to 
follow 
a 
full 
ight 
path 
starting 
with 
a 
takeoff 
and 
nishing 
with 
landing. 
At 
takeoff, 
the 
birds 
start 
at 
the 
small 
velocity 
generated 
by 
a 
jump 
and 
gradually 
build 
up 
the 
speed 
trying 
to 
catch 
up 
to 
the 
path. 
The 
extreme 
bending 
of 
feathers 
is 
apparent 
during 
takeoff, 
especially 
for 
the 
eagle's 
long 
feathers. 
In 
order 
to 
execute 
a 
turn, 
a 
bird 
compensates 
for 
inertia 
by 
tilting 
its 
body 
and 
using 
an 
asymmetric 
wingbeat. 
When 
landing, 
a 
bird 
uses 
the 
air 
drag 
of 
its 
wings 
and/or 
aps 
against 
the 
direction 
of 
movement 
to 
slow 
down. 


Because 
of 
the 
different 
mass, 
size, 
and 
skeletal 
structure, 
the 
wingbeats 
of 
these 
birds 
are 
different. 
For 
example, 
during 
takeoff, 
the 
raven 
folds 
its 
wings 
inwards 
at 
upstroke, 
while 
the 
eagle 
sweeps 
its 
wings 
forward. 
The 
forward 
sweep 
of 
the 
eagle 
also 
resembles 
the 
wingbeat 
pattern 
of 
a 
real 
bird 
of 
similar 
dimensions, 
as 
shown 
in 
Figure 
10.

Some 
values 
used 
in 
and 
resulting 
from 
the 
simulations 
and 
optimizations. 
Note 
that 
the 
ight 
and 
optimization 
times 
refer 
to 
the 
times 
for 
the 
full 
ight 
paths. 
The 
machine 
used 
is 
a 
2.8 
GHz 
Pentium 
4 
PC. 
For 
each 
bird, 
the 
same 
metric 
weight 
values 
are 
used 
for 
all 
paths. 


We 
can 
also 
apply 
environment 
forces 
such 
as 
a 
gust 
of 
wind 
by 
including 
the 
effect 
of 
directional 
wind 
in 
the 
aerodynamic 
model. 
In 
the 
simulation, 
the 
eagle 
rst 
gets 
blown 
off 
the 
path, 
and 
then 
readjusts 
its 
wingbeats 
to 
counteract 
the 
wind 
force. 
When 
the 
wind 
disappears, 
it 
returns 
to 
its 
normal 
ight 
pattern. 


The 
simulated 
annealing 
process 
was 
able 
to 
nd 
the 
sequence 
of 
wingbeats 
on 
each 
of 
the 
full 
ight 
paths 
from 
start 
to 
nish 
in 
one 
single 
run. 
However, 
every 
bird 
has 
its 
physical 
limitations 
and 
if 
the 
specied 
turn 
is 
too 
sharp, 
or 
the 
climbing 
angle 
is 
too 
steep, 
the 
bird 
may 
lose 
substantial 
speed 
and 
altitude 
while 
trying 
to 
follow 
the 
path 
or 
completely 
fail 
to 
take 
ight. 
When 
the 
bird 
diverges 
too 
far 
away 
from 
the 
path, 
the 
wingbeat 
motion 
no 
longer 
looks 
natural 
because 
the 
term 
wpEp 
overshadows 
the 
other 
terms 
in 
the 
objective 
function. 


We 
use 
a 
freely 
available 
library 
DynaMechs 
[McMillan 
et 
al. 
1995] 
for 
the 
forward 
dynamics 
simulation. 
We 
show 
the 
system 
performance 
and 
some 
of 
the 
important 
parameter 
values

use 
in

Discussion 
and 
future 
work 


The 
main 
contribution 
of 
this 
paper 
is 
a 
general 
algorithm 
for 
synthesis 
of 
dynamic 
bird 
ight 
simulations. 
Because 
our 
framework 
is 
based 
on 
a 
realistic 
bird 
model 
(we 
use 
appropriate 
physical, 
biomechanic, 
and 
aerodynamic 
properties), 
it 
naturally 
generalizes 
to 
birds 
of 
various 
shapes 
and 
sizes 
performing 
a 
variety 
of 
aerial 
maneuvers. 


Along 
the 
way 
to 
achieving 
our 
goal, 
we 
showed 
that 
with 
the 
compact 
parameterization 
of 
wingbeats 
and 
a 
proper 
metric 
to 
capture 
the 
natural 
aspects 
of 
ight 
motion, 
global 
optimization 
methods 
can 
successfully 
explore 
the 
space 
for 
a 
set 
of 
natural 
wingbeat 
parameters. 
We 
showed 
that 
modeling 
the 
twist 
of 
primary 
feathers 
(which 
reduces 
drag 
during 
upstroke) 
and 
accounting 
for 
feather 
overlap 
when 
computing 
wing 
area 
are 
important 
for 
successful

the 
bird 
ight 
model 
comes 
with 
complexity 
costs. 
In 
our 
design, 
we 
tried 
to 
simplify 
the 
model 
as 
much 
as 
possible 
without 
losing 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
resulting 
motion 
and 
general 
applicability 
to 
various 
bird 
models 
and 
aerial 
maneuvers. 
For 
example, 
we 
found 
that 
we 
could 
produce 
natural 


ight 
motion 
even 
if 
turbulence 
was 
left 
out 
of 
the 
aerodynamics 
model. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
exibility 
of 
feathers 
was 
important. 
In 
order 
to 
make 
the 
optimization 
problem 
fast 
and 
stable, 
we 
had 
to 
make 
further 
simplications 
to 
the 
model. 
For 
example, 
the 
feather 
elasticity 
was 
modeled 
as 
a 
rst-order 
ODE 
unlike 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
bird. 
Despite 
all 
simplications, 
our 
model 
is 
still 
quite 
complex, 
and 
further 
research 
needs 
to 
be 
conducted 
to 
explore 
additional 
abstractions. 


We 
found 
that 
in 
the 
process 
of 
dening 
a 
new 
bird, 
in 
addition 
to 
specifying 
a 
skeleton, 
the 
animator 
needs 
to 
also 
dene 
the 
speci
c 
aerodynamic 
properties 
of 
the 
bird's 
feathers. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
measurements 
from 
the 
literature 
are 
incomplete 
even 
in 
the 
few 
cases 
where 
they 
exist. 
Since 
our 
aerodynamic 
model 
is 
a 
simplication 
of 
reality, 
it 
is 
also 
not 
clear 
how 
to 
determine 
these 
parameters 
accurately. 
Currently 
in 
our 
framework 
this 
process 
is 
not 
too 
far 
removed 
from 
a 
simple 
trial 
and 
error 
process. 
In 
the 
future, 
these 
parameters 
could 
also 
be 
determined 
by 
optimization. 


Behaviors 
such 
as 
bounding 
ight 
and 
soaring 
are 
currently 
missing 
from 
our 
animation 
results. 
Although 
we 
can 
generate 
such 
behaviors 
by 
manually 
enforcing 
zero 
apping 
amplitude, 
a 
better 
approach 
would 
be 
to 
take 
the 
bird's 
metabolic 
rate 
and 
energy 
consumption 
into 
account 
when 
we 
search 
for 
optimal 
wingbeats. 


In 
this 
paper, 
we 
have 
described 
an 
ofine 
method 
for 
bird 
ight 
synthesis. 
Although 
synthesis 
of 
a 
bird 
ight 
takes 
a 
number 
of 
hours 
to 
complete, 
our 
framework 
could 
be 
used 
to 
populate 
the 
space 
of 
all 
possible 
ight 
movements. 
We 
are 
investigating 
ways 
to 
automatically 
determine 
ight 
controllers 
from 
these 
ight 
movements. 
Such 
controllers 
should 
determine 
an 
optimal 
wingbeat 
from 
the 
pre-generated 
ight 
movements 
without 
repeating 
the 
time-consuming 
optimizations 
(e.g. 
by 
interpolating 
neighboring 
wingbeats) 
and 
could 
be 
useful 
for 
realtime 
synthesis 
of 
bird 
ight 
and 
detailed 
ocking 
behaviors.

A 
Choice 
of 
composite 
functions 


During 
takeoff 
or 
at 
low 
ying 
speeds, 
the 
bird 
uses 
its 
tail 
to 
help 
generate 
lift 
[Norberg 
1990]. 
The 
motion 
of 
the 
tail 
should 
be 
synchronous 
with 
the 
wingbeats 
so 
that 
the 
bird 
can 
balance 
itself. 
Therefore, 
arm 
dihedral 
and 
tail 
bend 
both 
use 
the 
sinusoidal 
composite 
function 
g1. 


During 
downstroke, 
the 
bird 
holds 
its 
forearms 
xed 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
arms. 
During 
upstroke, 
the 
bird 
quickly 
retracts 
its 
wings 
and 
rotates 
forearms 
in 
order 
to 
reduce 
the 
downward 
drag 
caused 
by 
the 
primary 
feathers. 
It 
then 
quickly 
extends 
the 
wings 
again 
near 
the 
end 
of 
the 
upstroke 
to 
prepare 
for 
the 
next 
downstroke 
[Poore 
et 
al. 
1997]. 
We 
therefore 
use 
g2 
for 
arm 
and 
forearm 
twists 
and 
wing 
spread. 
We 
also 
use 
g2 
for 
arm 
sweep 
since 
the 
sweep 
joint 
also 
affects 
wing 
spread. 


B 
Updating 
desired 
orientations 


While 
desired 
position 
and 
velocity 
are 
obtained 
directly 
from 
the 
path 
specication, 
the 
desired 
orientation 
for 
the 
bird 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
wingbeat 
q 
∗ 
is 
harder 
to 
determine. 
We 
use 
the 
heuristic

r 


that 
q 
∗ 
is 
such 
that 
the 
bird's 
apping 
generates 
acceleration 
in 
the 


r 


direction 
of 
the 
desired 
acceleration 
a 
∗ 
. 
We 
also 
assume 
that 
the 
birds 
are 
designed 
to 
generate 
acceleration 
in 
the 
up 
direction 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
bird's 
trunk. 


The 
desired 
acceleration 
a 
∗ 
is 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
centrifugal 
acceleration 
ac, 
tangential 
deceleration 
at 
, 
and 
the 
negation 
of 
gravity 
􀀀g. 
Note 
that 
we 
disregard 
(forward) 
tangential 
acceleration. 


With 
the 
point 
p(s1) 
on 
p 
that 
is 
closest 
to 
the 
end 
position 
of 
the 
bird 
qp(t1), 
we 
compute 
ac 
using 


mkq˙ 
p(t1)k2 


ac 
= 
n(s1)

r(s1) 


where 
r(s1) 
is 
the 
radius 
of 
curvature 
of 
p 
at 
p(s1) 
and 
n(s1) 
the 
principal 
normal 
to 
p. 
We 
approximate 
at 
using 


􀀀R(kq˙ 
p(t0)k􀀀kq˙ 
p(t1)k) 
v(s1)

at 
= 


t1 
􀀀t0 
kv(s1)k 


where 
R 
is 
the 
ramp 
function 
dened 
in 
equation 
(2). 
We 
further 
require 
that, 
with 
q 
∗ 
r 
, 
the 
horizontal 
component 
of 
the 
direction 
the 
bird 
is 
facing 
is 
the 
same 
as 
the 
horizontal 
component 
of 
the 
desired 
airspeed. 


Note 
that 
although 
computing 
orientation 
this 
way 
works 
well 
for 
us 
in 
most 
cases, 
it 
is 
a 
very 
rough 
approximation 
and 
not 
well 
dened 
on 
a 
path 
with 
(nearly) 
vertical 
segments.
