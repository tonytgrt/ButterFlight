Introduction 


Physical simulation has been invested for more than two decades in computer 
graphics
: since Terzopoulos et. 
a
l
’
s seminal paper on elastically deformable 
models[TPBF87], numerous researchers have partaken in the quest for the visually 
and physically plausible animation of deformable objects. This inherently 
interdisciplinary field 
elegantly combines 
Newtonian 
dynamics, continuum 
mechanics, numerical computation, differential geometry, vector calculus, 
approximation theory and Computer Graphics into a vast and powerful toolkit, 
which is being further explored and extended. The field 
is inconstant flux, active 
and fruitfu
l.
[NMK05] 


Our authoring tool, Hand of 
Midas
, 
is based on a new fast and robust method 
to simulate various types of solid, proposed 
by 
Muller et. al [MC12]. 
This approach 
adopts oriented particles to solve the singulari
ty problem of degenerate cases and 
takes shape matching [MHTG05] into the framework of position based dynamics 
[MHHR06], which allows us to create complex dynamic objects with only a small 
number of simulation particles and makes turning a visual mesh into 
a physical 
object a simple task. 


In this 
literature survey
, 
we 
t
race 
from the seminal work [TPBF87], mainly 
through mesh free methods 
of 
particle systems, including 
couple
d 
particle systems, 
SPH, point
-
based animation, to the 
novel 
idea of shape matching, 
position based 
dynamics and finally solid simulation with oriented particles, which we plan to 
implement.

The research evolution is shown in the following graph: 


 


 


[TPBF87] 
In this seminal paper, Terzopoulos and his co
-
workers compute the 



dynamics of deformable models from the potential energy stored in the elastically 
deformed body. For volumetric objects, they define the deformation energy as the 
weighted matrix norm of the difference between the metric tensors of the 
deformed and 
origina
l shape, integrated over the entire continuum. The 
continuous variational derivative of this energy functional is discretized using the 
Method of Finite Differences, and the simulation is moved forward through time by 
semi
-
implicit integration. This work i
s further evolved in [TF88] and [TW88] where 
the model is extended to cover plasticity and fracture. A hybrid mesh/particle 
method for heating and melting deformable models is given in [TPF89]. 


However, the contribution of [TPBF97] is not only to the FD me
thod, but also 
the whole field 
of physically
-
based animation. 
Before 
the elastically deformable 
model
, most methods for computer graphics modeling are kinematic; that is. 
T
he 
shapes are compositions of geometrically or algebraically defined primitives. 
Kin
ematic models are passive because they do not interact with each other or with 
external forces. The models are either stationary or are subjected to motion 
according to prescribed trajectories. Expertise is required to create natural and 
pleasing dynamics 
with passive models. Terzopoulos proposed models based on 
elasticity theory which describes the shape and motion of deformable materials. 
Elastically deformable models are active, they respond in a natural way to applied 
forces, constraints, ambient media, 
and impenetrable obstacles. The models are 
fundamentally dynamic and realistic animation is created by numerically solving 
their underlying 
differential 
equations. Thus, the description of shape and the 



description of motion are unified. 


 


 
Since Terzopoul
ous
’ 
pioneering 
work on simulating deformable objects in the 
context of computer graphics, many deformable models have been proposed. 
A 
large number of mesh based methods for both off
-
line and interactive simulation of 
deformable objects have been proposed
. Examples are mass
-
spring systems, the 
Boundary Element Method(BEM) and the Finite Element Method(FEM). 


 


[NTVR92] 
This paper gives 
rise to mesh
-
free methods for the solution of partial 
differential equations. 
It describes the new 
“
diffuse approximation
” 
method, 
which may be presented as a generalization of the widely used 
“
finite element 
approximation
” 
method. It removes some of the limitations of the finite element 
approximation related to the regularity of approximations functions, and to mesh 
generatio
n requirements. The diffuse approximation method may be used for 
generating smooth approximations of functions known at given sets of points and 
for accurately estimating (DEM), which presents several advantages compared to 
the 
“
finite element method
”
(FEM)
, specially for evaluating the derivatives of the 
unknown functions. 


 


[Ton91] 
[Ton98] 
Particle systems were first defined in computer graphics as sets 
of moving points, without interaction between them[Ree83]. Later on particle 
systems have been wide
ly used for simulating inelastic deformations, using 



attraction
-
repulsion force, which derives from the Lennard
-
Jones potential, 
proposed for modeling pairwise microscopic interactions between atoms in a liquid. 
Tonnesen 
proposed 
that 
particles which inter
act with each other depending on 
their spatial relationship are referred to as s
pa
tially coupled particle systems. The 
interactions between 
particles evolve dynamically over time, thus, complex 
geometry and topological changes can be easily modeled using t
his approach. 
Tonnesen presented a framework for physically based animation of solids and 
liquids based on dynamically coupled particles which represent the volume of an 
object [Ton91] [Ton98]. 
In [Ton91], an iso
-
surface of some 
“
implicit 
function” 
contro
lled by the particles is used to compute a smooth surface, essential for 
interfacing particles with other models. 
In [Ton98], Tonnesen 
introduc
ed oriented 
particles for deformable surface modeling, where each particle represents a small 
surface element (ca
lled surfel). Each surfel has a local coordinate frame, given by 
the position of the particle, a normal vector and a local tangent plane to the surface. 
To 
arrange the particles into surface
-
like arrangements, interaction potentials are 
defined which favor 
locally plannar or locally spherical arrangements. 


 


[DC96] 
Descrun and Cani were among the first to use mesh free models in 
computer graphics. In 
[DC95]
, soft , inelastic substances that can split and merge 
are animated by combining particle systems with 
simple inter
-
particle forces and 
implicit surfaces for collision detection and rendering. The Smoothed Particle 
Hydrodynamics (SPH) method [Mon92] is applied in [DC96].The smoothed particles 



defined in this paper can be viewed either as matter elements, o
r sample points 
scattered in a soft substance. Each of them represents a small volume of inelastic 
material that moves over time. In practice, smoothed particles are used to 
approximate the values and derivatives of continuous physical quantities, such as 
local mass density or pressure, that need 
to be computed during the simulation. 
Smoothed particles ensure valid and stable simulation of a state equation 
describing the physical behavior of the material. They also use them for defining 
the surface of the s
ubstance in a coherent way using the level sets 
of the 
mass 
density function. 
Furthermore, as a particle based Lagrangian approach, it has the 
advantage that mass is trivially conserved and convection is dispensable. This 
reduces both the programming and c
omputational complexity and is therefore 
suitable for interactive applications. 


 


[
MKN04
] 
Muller et al. introduced to the graphics community a mesh
-
free 
continuum mechanics
-
based framework for modeling and animating a wide 
spectrum of volumetric objects, wi
th material properties anywhere in the range 
from stiff elastic to highly plastic. Both the volume and the surface representation 
are point based, which allows arbitrarily large deviations from the original shape. In 
each step, 
the spatial derivatives of t
he discrete displacement field using a Moving 
Least Squares (MLS) procedure is 
computed
, from where strains, stresses and 
elastic forces at each simulated point can be obtained. And finally, based on these 
forces, the equations of motions can be solved. 
In 
addition, this paper proposes 



techniques for modeling and animating a point
-
sampled surface 
that 
dynamically 
adapts to deformations of the underlying volumetric model. 


 
The material properties ranging from stiff elastic to highly 
plastic are 
extended 
to 
viscous materials such as fluids by merging 
the solid mechanics equation with 
the Navier
-
Stokes equations in [KAG 05] and 
t
he framework is extended in 
[PKA 05] 
to cope with fracturing. 


 


[MHTG05] 
related to modal analysis approaches, this paper 
proposes 
ge
ometrically motivated approach for simulating deformable objects. The main 
idea is to replace energies in point based animation by geometric constraints and 
forces by distances of current positions to goal positions. These goal positions are 
determined via 
a generalized shape matching of an undeformed rest state with the 
current deformed state of the point cloud. 
Since points are always drawn towards 
well
-
defined locations, the overshooting problem of explicit integration schemes is 
eliminated. The versatil
ity of the approach in terms of object representations that 
can be handled
, 
the efficiency in terms of memory and computational complexity, 
and the unconditional stability of the dynamic simulation make the approach 
particularly interesting for games. 


 


[MH
HR
06] 
This paper introduced the Position Based Dynamics approach, 
which 
omits the velocity layer and immediately 
works on the positions. It generalizes and 
extends the method proposed by [Jak01]. A Verlet
-
based integrator is used which 



bypasses the force a
nd velocity layers and directly modifies the positions of 
particles or vertices of a mesh. The main advantage of a position based approach is 
its controllability. Overshooting problems of 
expli
cit integration schemes in force 
based systems can be avoided. 
In addition, collision constraints can be handled 
easily and penetrations can be resolved completely by projecting to valid locations. 


 
The simplicity of the method is due to the fact that the solver processes the 
constraints one by one in a Gauss
-
Se
idel type manner. In contrast to global 
Newton
-
Raphson solvers, the local solver can easily handle non
-
linear constrains as 
well as constrains based on inequalities. Unfortunately, this advantage comes at the 
price of much slower convergence. [M07]
propose 
a multi
-
grid based process to 
speed up the convergence of PBD significantly while keeping the power of the 
method to process general non
-
linear constraints. 


 


[MKBG10] 
In[MKN04], MLS is only stable if local particle neighborhoods are in 
non
-
degenerate conf
igurations. This problem was fixed by Marin et al. who 
introduced the concept of elastons. In addition to the deformation field, the elaston 
approach also stores derivatives. This way, particles in zero, one, two and 
three
-
dimensional configurations can be 
simulated robustly using generalized MLS 
(GMLS). 


 


[MC12] 
Based on 
[MHHR06] 
and [MHTG05], this paper proposes a new fast and 
robust method to simulate various types of solid including rigid, plastic and soft 



bodies as well as one, two and three dimensional 
structures such as ropes, cloth 
and volumetric objects. The underlying idea is to use oriented particles that store 
rotation and spin, along with the usual linear attributes, i.e. position and velocity. 
This additional information adds substantially to tr
aditional particle methods. First, 
particles can be represented by anisotropic shapes such as ellipsoids, which 
approximate surfaces more accurately than spheres. Second, shape matching 
becomes robust for sparse structures such as chains of particles or ev
en single 
particles because the undefined degrees of freedom are captured in the rotational 
states of the particles. Third, the full transformation stored in the particles, 
including translation 
and 
rotation, can be used for robust 
skinning 
of graphical 
me
shes and for transforming plastic deformations back into the rest state.
